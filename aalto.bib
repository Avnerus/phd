The study proposed model asserts that ``Co-presence'', ``Intimacy'', ``Immediacy'', ``Perceived Enjoyment'', and ``Perceived ease of use'' formed individuals' ``Attitude'' towards ``behavioral intention'' to use SNSs. The results support all formulated hypotheses. The proposed model in this study explains 69\% of individual's attitude or feelings towards adoption the SNSs, 59\% of the variance in ``Behavioral Intention'' and 54\% of the variance in ``Usage Behaviour''. The present study has shown the importance of social presence's factors, namely co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy, in explaining individuals' intentions and behavior. The study findings confirmed that social presence positively influence SNS usage indirectly through user attitude, and as aforementioned that three factors, namely co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy are framing the construct of social presence. Thus, this study is the first empirical effort to examine the impact of co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy in determining intention or behaviour.},

Avatar identification is one potential moderator. We integrated three lines of research on moral disengagement, moral foundations, and avatar identification to conceptually replicate and extend previous studies on video games and morality. We used a 2 (justification: unjustified vs. justified violence) x 2 (avatar: high vs. low identification) between-participants experiment with guilt, moral cleansing, and post-play sacredness of the care and fairness foundations as moral outcomes. Participants (N = 233) also completed measures of morally-relevant traits before gameplay. Participants felt guiltier after unjustified (vs. justified) violence. People with high trait levels of care foundation salience and personal distress also felt guiltier. Unjustified (vs. justified) violence did not affect the other moral outcomes. Avatar identification did not moderate the effects of unjustified violence, but this is likely because participants identified less with their avatars after engaging in unjustified violence. This unexpected effect suggests that players distance themselves from immoral avatars. Theoretical implications are discussed.},

Recent advances have enabled such experiences through cloud-based infrastructure; however, this is not currently possible on most mobile robots due to the need to access cloud-based (remote) AI technology. Here we describe a toolkit that supports interactive avatars using cloud-based resources for human-robot interaction. The toolkit deals with communication and rendering latency through parallelization and mechanisms that obscure delays. This technology can be used to put an interactive face on a mobile robot. But does an animated face on a robot actually make the interaction more effective or useful? To answer this question, we conducted a user study comparing human-robot interaction using text, audio, a realistic avatar, and a simplistic cartoon avatar. Although response time was longer for both avatar interfaces (due to increased computation and communication), this had no significant effect on participant satisfaction with the avatar-based interfaces. When asked about general preferences, more participants preferred the audio interface over the text interface, the avatar interfaces over the audio interface, and the realistic avatar interface over the cartoon avatar interface. This chapter includes and expands on material previously published [1, 2].},

  abstract = {YOLO is a non-anthropomorphic social robot designed to stimulate creativity in children. This robot was envisioned to be used by children during free-play where they use the robot as a character for the stories they create. During play, YOLO makes use of creativity techniques that promote the creation of new story-lines. Therefore, the robot serves as a tool that has the potential to stimulate creativity in children during the interaction. Particularly, YOLO can stimulate divergent and convergent thinking for story creations. Additionally, YOLO can have different personalities, providing it with socially intelligent and engaging behaviors. This work provides open-source and open-access of YOLO's hardware. The design of the robot was guided by psychological theories and models on creativity, design research including user-centered design practices with children, and informed by expert working in the field of creativity. Specifically, we relied on established theories of personality to inform the social behavior of the robot, and on theories of creativity to design creativity stimulating behaviors. Our design decisions were then based on design fieldwork with children. The end product is a robot that communicates using non-verbal expressive modalities (lights and movements) equipped with sensors that detect the playful behaviors of children. YOLO has the potential to be used as a research tool for academic studies, and as a toy for the community to engage in personal fabrication. The overall benefit of this proposed hardware is that it is open-source, less expensive than existing ones, and one that children can build by themselves under expert supervision.},

These techniques were developed based on the psychological theories of creativity development and on research from creativity experts who work with children. Besides promoting creativity, this software allows the creation of Social Behaviors that enable the robot to behave as a believable character. We built 3 main social behavior parameters: Exuberant, Aloof, and Harmonious. These behaviors are meant to ease immersive play and the process of character creation. The 3 social behaviors were based on psychological theories of personality and developed using children's input during co-design studies.

Participants were asked to customize their avatars to look either like themselves or someone completely different. Participants interacted wearing either similar avatar uniforms (salient common identity) or different clothes (nonsalient identity). The linguistic style matching (LSM) algorithm was employed to calculate verbal mimicry in the communication exchanged during a joint task. The results suggested that verbal mimicry significantly predicted lesser social distance and greater social attraction towards the outgroup member. These results are discussed in terms of their contribution for potential intergroup models of avatar communication in immersive virtual environments (IVEs).},

  abstract = {Intergroup conflicts are a major scourge across the world, leading to death, injury and pain as well as a huge societal and economic impact. One of the leading theories advocated for conflict resolution and prevention is the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1954). According to this theory, contact under certain conditions will create a positive intergroup encounter, which in turn, will reduce prejudice and discrimination, and bring about an improvement in intergroup relations. Although the Internet has become an accessible and pivotal medium of communication there are surprisingly few projects that make use of its potential for bridging between groups in conflict. This article explains how the Internet's unique qualities may help overcome the major obstacles inherent in the Contact Hypothesis. In doing so, it differentiates between structured and unstructured online intergroup contact, and provides an analysis of some of the leading online intergroup contact platforms, both past and present. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research in this field.},

Prior to the large-scale implementation of a complex ERP system, one of the groups consisted of experienced ICT users, while the other consisted of inexperienced users. The significance of the nature of the interplay between task-technology fit, the leadership and the ICT-organization integration processes, and employees' levels of self-determination, is investigated in relation to different user practices, and in particular, how it may institutionalize involuntary non-use for the group of inexperienced employees. Previous experience is a moderating variable, together with participation and interaction possibilities in everyday work. In a perspective of sociomateriality where user practices are seen as developing through situated everyday actions and interactions, the relationship between demands, control and support and inherent need satisfaction is elaborated. This study shows that employees' use or non-use of new ICT has to do with how leadership behaviors affect the ICT-organization integration process and its outcomes, and how this process may serve the experienced employee group over the inexperienced, and as such contribute to involuntary non-use of new ICT for the latter.},

However, the number of commercial solutions using RL is limited, one reason being the complexity related to the design of RL. Therefore, a method to identify complexities of RL for industrial applications is presented in this thesis. It was used on 15 applications inspired from four industrial companies. Complexity was especially identified in relation to the reward functions. Thus two Linear Inverse RL (IRL) algorithms in which the reward function is represented as a linear combination of features, was tested using expert data. Some of the tests indicated a visual better result than tests carried out using RL. The process of designing features shared similarities with the process of designing a reward function. The added complexity of implementing Linear IRL and constructing expert data is thus not always a simpler approach. The IRL method GAIL, which requires no feature construction, was furthermore tested showing potential.},

In the present work, participants conveyed eight emotions to a small humanoid robot via touch. We found that female participants conveyed emotions for a longer time, using more varied interaction and touching more regions on the robot's body, compared to male participants. Several differences between emotions were found such that emotions could be classified by the valence of the emotion conveyed, by combining touch amount and duration. Overall, these results show high agreement with those reported for human\textendash human affective tactile communication and could also have impact on the design and placement of tactile sensors on humanoid robots.},

  abstract = {Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of inferring the reward function of an agent, given its policy or observed behavior. Analogous to RL, IRL is perceived both as a problem and as a class of methods. By categorically surveying the current literature in IRL, this article serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners of machine learning and beyond to understand the challenges of IRL and select the approaches best suited for the problem on hand. The survey formally introduces the IRL problem along with its central challenges such as the difficulty in performing accurate inference and its generalizability, its sensitivity to prior knowledge, and the disproportionate growth in solution complexity with problem size. The article elaborates how the current methods mitigate these challenges. We further discuss the extensions to traditional IRL methods for handling: inaccurate and incomplete perception, an incomplete model, multiple reward functions, and nonlinear reward functions. This survey concludes the discussion with some broad advances in the research area and currently open research questions.},

  abstract = {Recent generations of humanoid robots increasingly resemble humans in shape and articulatory capacities. This progress has motivated researchers to design dancing robots that can mimic the complexity and style of human choreographic dancing. Such complicated actions are usually programmed manually and ad hoc. However, this approach is both tedious and inflexible. Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed the learning-from-observation (LFO) training method to overcome this difficulty.1-2 LFO enables a robot to acquire knowledge of what to do and how to do it from observing human demonstrations. Direct mapping from human joint angles to robot joint angles doesn't work well because of the dynamic and kinematic differences between the observed person and the robot (for example, weight, balance, and arm and leg lengths). LFO therefore relies on predesigned task models, which represent only the actions (and features thereof) that are essential to mimicry. Then it adapts these actions to the robot's morphology and dynamics so that it can mimic the movement. This indirect, two-step mapping is crucial for robust imitation and performance.},

Here, we focus on the visual depiction of refugees to understand how exposure to the dominant visual framing used in the media, depicting them in large groups of faceless individuals, affects their dehumanization and sets off political consequences. Seeing images of large groups resulted in greater implicit dehumanization compared with images depicting small groups. Moreover, after viewing images of large groups, participants showed increased preference for more dominant, less trustworthy political leaders and supported less prorefugee policies and more anti-refugee policies. Lastly, the extent to which participants felt reduced pity for images depicting large groups mediated the effect of visual framing on the choice of more authoritarian leaders. What we see in the media and how it is shown has attitudinal, behavioural as well as political consequences.},

Design: Descriptive, cross-\-sectional. Conducted in 2014\textendash 2015 in an urban area of the western United States using a purposive sample of adults 18 years of age or older. Methods: Respondents completed a survey that included the Negative Attitudes Toward Robots Scale (NARS) and two questions taken or modified from the European Commission's Autonomous System 2015 Report. Analyses were conducted to compare perceptions and demographic factors by age groups (young adults:18\textendash 44, middle-aged adults: 45\textendash 64, and older adults: {$>$}65 years old). Findings: Sample included 499 individuals (n\,=\,322 age 18\textendash 44 years, n\,=\,50 age 45\textendash 64 years, and n\;=\;102 age 65\textendash 98 years). There were no significant differences between age groups for 9 of the 11 items regarding social impact of robots and comfort with robots. There were no significant differences by age groups for 9 of the 14 items in the NARS. Among those items with statistically significant differences, the mean scores indicate similar sentiments for each group. Conclusions: Older, middle-\-aged, and younger adults had similar attitudes regarding the social impact of and comfort with robots; they also had similar negative attitudes towards robots. Findings dispel current perceptions that older adults are not as receptive to robots as other adults. This has implications for nurses who integrate supportive robots in their practice.},

While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term ``Zoom Fatigue'' caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.},

But this is only part of the long-term reconciliation process, which requires the formation of peaceful relations based on mutual trust and acceptance, cooperation, and consideration of mutual needs. The psychological aspect of reconciliation requires a change in the conflictive ethos, especially with respect to societal beliefs about group goals, about the adversary group, about the ingroup, about intergroup relations, and about the nature of peace. In essence, psychological reconciliation requires the formation of an ethos of peace, but this is extremely difficult in cases of intractable conflict.

While ANT was originally rooted in Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approaches, ANT has become a theoretical framework commonly used by scholars in numerous disciplines beyond STS, including Information Sciences. Although some scholars consider ANT to be now closer to sociomateriality studies, we claim that ANT differs from sociomateriality in that it suggests a different notion of power. In ANT, power results from actors' associations enacted into being rather than the sociomateriality claim that power results from existing power structures. We draw from our work on information technologies and social movements to illustrate this important distinction, and to show how ANT can be further strengthened by including the study of histories, memories and trajectories, in order to better understand power relations as associations enacted into being. In this way, we offer a deeper understanding of ANT and its utility for STS research in general, and information studies in particular.},

To do so, we conducted an extended replication of the classic social psychological shooter bias paradigm using robot stimuli to explore whether effects known from humanhuman intergroup experiments would generalize to robots that were racialized as Black and White. Reaction-time based measures revealed that participants demonstrated `shooter-bias' toward both Black people and robot racialized as Black. Participants were also willing to attribute a race to the robots depending on their racialization and demonstrated a high degree of inter-subject agreement when it came to these attributions.},

  abstract = {Discourse analysis has been introduced into nursing research as an approach which has the potential to offer new perspectives and to pose new questions to taken-for-granted assumptions. However, critique has arisen that when applied to nursing studies, the epistemological foundation of the discourse analysis is often overlooked. It is furthermore claimed that the methodological inspiration does not lead to any new insights and that these studies can hardly be differentiated from more traditional studies. This study supports this critique, arguing that the challenges of implementing discourse analysis in nursing research reflect a dominant pattern of thought in the discourse of the nursing profession that have held sway throughout the last century. We argue that this pattern of thought stems from the Western philosophy of consciousness and the conception of the sovereign subject. By applying a discourse analytical perspective to the discourse of the nursing profession itself, this study elucidates the challenges of applying discourse analysis in nursing research.},

The findings of this study advance theory and have practical implications for the design of immersive diversity initiatives. We tested avatar creation and the gaming app as a new modality for stimulating perspective-taking. In addition, we explored how sex and race intersect in virtual embodiment and stereotyping. Results showed that creating and embodying a Black avatar produced more favorable beliefs about African American men, but not African American women, and greater support for ``pro-minority'' policies in comparison to creating and playing a White avatar. Avatar liking was a significant moderator, but self-presence had no effect.},

The present work is an empirical study of the role of self-presence in a social virtual world on individuals' offline health, appearance, and well-being. Second Life users (N=279) completed an online questionnaire about their experiences of presence in the virtual world, the influence of their avatar on their offline appearance and health behaviors, and their level of satisfaction with the relationships they developed online. It was hypothesized that self-presence would be positively associated with avatar influence on health and appearance and that self-presence would render the influence of spatial and social presence statistically non-significant. Additionally, it was hypothesized that self-presence would be positively associated with satisfaction with relationships developed in the virtual world. Support was found for these predictions. Results suggest that self-presence is uniquely linked to the influence of the virtual self on offline health and appearance and is a significant predictor of the development of satisfying online relationships. Individual differences and potential prosocial effects of virtual worlds are also discussed.},

Three hundred and twenty-two 3rd and 4th grade students from both Israeli\textendash Jewish and Israeli\textendash Palestinian schools in the ethnically mixed city of Jaffa were randomly assigned to either intervention or control classes. Members of the intervention classes engaged in ECEP's activities, whereas members of the control classes engaged in a social\textendash emotional learning program. The program's outcomes were measured a week before, immediately after, and 15 months following termination. Results showed that the ECEP decreased stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward the other group and increased positive feelings and readiness for social contact with the other group upon program termination. Additionally, the effects of the ECEP were generalized to an ethnic group (i.e., Ethiopians) with whom the ECEP's participants did not have any contact. Finally, the ECEP retained its significant effect 15 months after the program's termination, despite the serious clashes between Israel and the Palestinians that occurred during that time. This empirical support for the ECEP'S utility in reducing prejudice makes it potentially applicable to other areas in the world, especially those that are characterized by ethnic tension and violent conflicts.},

These systems can be worn by users, carried around, and integrated in their everyday lives, thus enabling a more natural manner to deliver tactile cues. At the same time, the design of these types of devices presents new issues: the challenge is the correct identification of design guidelines, with the two-fold goal of minimizing system encumbrance and increasing the effectiveness and naturalness of stimulus delivery. Fabrics can represent a viable solution to tackle these issues. They are specifically thought ``to be worn'', and could be the key ingredient to develop wearable haptic interfaces conceived for a more natural HRI. In this paper, the author will review some examples of fabric-based WHS that can be applied to different body locations, and elicit different haptic perceptions for different application fields. Perspective and future developments of this approach will be discussed.},

The ubiquity of touch screens in daily life increases consumer accessibility and extended use for shopping, whilst software innovations have increased the functionality of touch screens, for example the extent to which images respond to fingertip control. This study examines how users engage with interactive visual rotation and tactile simulation features while browsing fashion clothing products on touch screen devices and thus contributes to retail touch screen research that previously focused on in-store kiosks and window displays. Findings show that three dimensions of user engagement (endurability, novelty and felt involvement) are positively influenced by both forms of manipulation. In order to examine the extent to which touch screen user engagement varies with individual preferences for an in-store experience, the paper also examines whether user engagement outcomes are mediated by an individual's need for physical touch. Findings indicate that the need for touch does not explain the variance between individuals. We conclude that touch screen technology complements the physical retail environment.},

People may treat robots as mechanistic artifacts or may consider them to be intentional agents. This might result in explaining robots' behavior as stemming from operations of the mind (intentional interpretation) or as a result of mechanistic design (mechanistic interpretation). Here, we examined whether individual attitudes toward robots can be differentiated on the basis of default neural activity pattern during resting state, measured with electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants observed scenarios in which a humanoid robot was depicted performing various actions embedded in daily contexts. Before they were introduced to the task, we measured their resting state EEG activity. We found that resting state EEG beta activity differentiated people who were later inclined toward interpreting robot behaviors as either mechanistic or intentional. This pattern is similar to the pattern of activity in the default mode network, which was previously demonstrated to have a social role. In addition, gamma activity observed when participants were making decisions about a robot's behavior indicates a relationship between theory of mind and said attitudes. Thus, we provide evidence that individual biases toward treating robots as either intentional agents or mechanistic artifacts can be detected at the neural level, already in a resting state EEG signal.},

Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to inclusive generalized prejudice, r = -.03, 95\%CI [-.07, -.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with inclusive generalized prejudice (r = -.23, 95\%CI [-.31, -.16]). Several target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice; importantly, however, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups. These results provide new and more nuanced insights into the relationship between personality and prejudice.},

  abstract = {Nowadays a significant part of human-human interaction takes place over distance. Tele-operated robot avatars, in which an operator's behaviours are portrayed by a robot proxy, have the potential to improve distance interaction, e.g., improving social presence and trust. However, having communication mediated by a robot changes the perception of the operator's appearance and behaviour, which have been shown to be used alongside vocal cues in judging personality. In this paper we present a study that investigates how robot mediation affects the way the personality of the operator is perceived. More specifically, we aim to investigate if judges of personality can be consistent in assessing personality traits, can agree with one another, can agree with operators' self-assessed personality, and shift their perceptions to incorporate characteristics associated with the robot's appearance. Our experiments show that (i) judges utilise robot appearance cues along with operator vocal cues to make their judgements, (ii) operators' arm gestures reproduced on the robot aid personality judgements, and (iii) how personality cues are perceived and evaluated through speech, gesture and robot appearance is highly operator-dependent. We discuss the implications of these results for both tele-operated and autonomous robots that aim to portray personality.},

  abstract = {Humanoid robot avatars are a potential new telecommunication tool, whereby a user is remotely represented by a robot that replicates their arm, head, and possible face movements. They have been shown to have a number of benefits over more traditional media such as phones or video calls. However, using a teleoperated humanoid as a communication medium inherently changes the appearance of the operator, and appearance-based stereotypes are used in interpersonal judgments (whether consciously or unconsciously). One such judgment that plays a key role in how people interact is personality. Hence, we have been motivated to investigate if and how using a robot avatar alters the perceived personality of teleoperators. To do so, we carried out two studies where participants performed 3 communication tasks, solo in study one and dyadic in study two, and were recorded on video both with and without robot mediation. Judges recruited using online crowdsourcing services then made personality judgments of the participants in the video clips. We observed that judges were able to make internally consistent trait judgments in both communication conditions. However, judge agreement was affected by robot mediation, although which traits were affected was highly task dependent. Our most important finding was that in dyadic tasks personality trait perception was shifted to incorporate cues relating to the robot's appearance when it was used to communicate. Our findings have important implications for telepresence robot design and personality expression in autonomous robots.},

During the Israel Palestine conflict, the primary form of movement restriction that has been documented is closure to day migrant workers of the borders between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In recent years, however, restrictions on movement throughout the West Bank have been applied to the general Palestinian population. International accompaniment work has endeavoured to resist such restrictions and to escape the limitations of traditional human rights documentation. In doing so, it presents alternative views: of the population as more than `worker'; and the impact of restrictions on both the individual and the collective. It also demonstrates the material, emotional and cultural aspects of movement. Observation emerges as a principal form of resistance. This suggests that restrictions can be seen as discipline in Foucault's sense. The West Bank experience, however, is better characterized by a negative rather than the positive conception of discipline associated with the productive control of labour.},

As an example of post-Kantian philosophy, Serres critiques the classical logic of identity as based on a `third man' argument. This third space \textendash{} personified as the parasite \textendash{} is essential to thinking communication and transformation in systems. Parasitism operates through the logic of taking without giving or `abuse value'. But the parasite nevertheless makes exchange possible by creating connections between otherwise incommensurable forms of ordering. Human relations oscillate through period of disequilibrium, often involving scapegoating and exclusion, as parasitic cascades emerge. However, parasites in the form of jokers and quasi-objects create powerful mechanisms for creating collectivity and individuality. The `dark organizational theory' of Serres allows for adequate descriptions of these processes.},

  abstract = {Interaction patterns of reciprocity and compensation have received extensive consideration in the literature on mutual influence processes. Unfortunately, conflicting and ambiguous definitions of these concepts, along with inadequate differentiation from other patterns such as matching, convergence, divergence, and complementarity have hindered theoretical and empirical progress. This article is dedicated to sorting out the differences among the various accommodation processes and offering appropriate constitutive definitions and operationalizations. It is proposed that definitions of reciprocity and compensation be distinguished from matching and complementarity in that the former incorporate principles of(1) directedness, (2) contingency, (3) both unidirectional and mutual influence, (4) change rather than maintenance, (5) directionality rather than magnitude of change, (6) intentional and automatic processes, and (7) functional equivalence of behaviors. Operationally, these criteria imply a focus on designs demonstrating causality or strong association between partner behaviors, concatenous and lagged responses, within-dyad and longitudinal analyses, and, for many purposes, a more molar perspective. Issues of macro versus micro measurement, perceived versus actual reciprocity and compensation, and reliance on observer versus participant perspectives are also considered.},

Passive and active assistive devices are becoming more commonly used to enhance lost hand strength and dexterity. Soft robotics is an emerging discipline that combines the classical principles of robotics with soft materials and could provide a new class of active assistive devices. Soft robotic assistive devices enable a human-robot interaction facilitated by compliant and light-weight structures.

  abstract = {We introduce Intermediated Reality (IR), a framework for intermediated communication enabling collaboration through remote possession of entities (e.g. toys) that come to life in mobile Mediated Reality (MR). As part of a two-way conversation demonstration, each person communicates through a toy figurine that is remotely located in front of the other participant. Each person's face is tracked through the front camera of their mobile devices and the tracking pose information is transmitted to the remote participant's device along with the synchronized captured voice audio, allowing a turn-based interactive avatar chat session, which we have called ToyMeet. By altering the camera video feed with a reconstructed appearance of the object in a deformed pose, we perform the illusion of movement in real-world objects to realize collaborative tele-present augmented reality (AR). In this turn based interaction, each participant first sees their own captured puppetry message locally with their device's front facing camera. Next, they receive a view of their counterpart's captured response locally (in AR) with seamless visual deformation of their local 3D toy seen through their device's rear facing camera. We detail optimization of the animation transmission and switching between devices with minimized latency for coherent smooth chat interaction. An evaluation of rendering performance and system latency is included. As an additional demonstration of our framework, we generate facial animation frames for 3D printed stop motion in collaborative mixed reality. This allows a reduction in printing costs since the in-between frames of key poses can be generated digitally with shared remote review.},

Unfortunately current methods generally do not scale well beyond the small tabular setting due to the need for an inner-loop MDP solver, and even non-Bayesian methods that do themselves scale often require extensive interaction with the environment to perform well, being inappropriate for high stakes or costly applications such as healthcare. In this paper we introduce our method, Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL), that addresses both of these issues by jointly learning an approximate posterior distribution over the reward that scales to arbitrarily complicated state spaces alongside an appropriate policy in a completely offline manner through a variational approach to said latent reward. Applying our method to real medical data alongside classic control simulations, we demonstrate Bayesian reward inference in environments beyond the scope of current methods, as well as task performance competitive with focused offline imitation learning algorithms.},

Robotic telepresence system is a newer variant of a telepresence system. Even though robot characteristics of having physical embodiment could be effective on building presence of itself, this could yield distortion of presence of a remote sender in telepresence. Thus, in order to determine effective methods of increasing sender presence during telecommunication, we perform a two within-participants experiment, considering the effects of the embodiment levels, by comparing a weakly-embodied telepresence system, a tablet and a strongly-embodied telepresence system, a telepresence robot (number of participants, N = 48). In this study, the participants engage in conversations with a remote sender either through a tablet or a telepresence robot. The results show that participants have a lesser sense of sender presence for a strongly-embodied telepresence system compared to the weakly-embodied telepresence system. On the other hand, participants perceived more presence of a telepresence system toward a strongly-embodied telepresence system than a weakly-embodied telepresence system. The implications of these findings are the weakly-embodied telepresence systems would be effectively used in settings where emotional connection is a priority. In addition, incorporating sensory modalities should be considered for neutralizing the negative effects of strong embodiment on presence.},

Even though certain characteristics of robots such as identity could be effective at generating a sense of presence, this risks yielding a distortion of presence in the remote sender. Thus, in order to find effective ways to increase presence, we executed an experiment comparing a telepresence robot with high identity and a telepresence robot with low identity. The 60 participants in this study engaged in a video call with a remote sender using either a telepresence robot with high identity or a telepresence robot with low identity. The results showed that participants felt more remote sender presence when interacting with the telepresence robot with low identity than they did with the one with high identity. On the other hand, when a telepresence robot has high identity, participants felt more presence toward the robot than they did toward the one with low identity. In the second study (N = 72), participants experienced two types of telepresence robots (identity level: a telepresence robot with high identity vs. a telepresence robot with low identity) with two types of remote senders (number of remote senders: single remote sender vs. multiple remote senders). The identity level of the robot and the number of remote senders affected the presence of the remote sender, telepresence, and the presence of the robot. We discuss in detail the implications for the design of telepresence robots in terms of increasing presence.},

  abstract = {Silverstone's `proper distance' is one of the most original and productive conceptualizations of a fundamental problem in the ethics of mediation: the humanization of vulnerable others. This is because `proper distance' is not only a normative but also, importantly, an analytical concept. Whereas in its normative dimension, proper distance refers to the degree of proximity required for mediated relationships of care and responsibility to develop, in its analytical dimension, the metaphorical vocabulary of space becomes an important resource in evaluating how mediation produces `humanity' through the positioning of mediated others along the axis of proximity\textendash distance. My application of this analytical vocabulary to the mediation of humanitarianism enables me to create a typology of paradigms of solidarity, namely `pity', `irony' and `agonism', highlighting the different ways in which their particular articulations of proximity\textendash distance produce distinct conceptions of `humanity' and, therefore, distinct proposals for solidarity towards vulnerable others. Focusing, specifically, on the critique of an emerging paradigm of solidarity as irony, I argue that, even though it appears as a promising response to pity and its misleading spatiality of universal proximity, irony celebrates consumerism as a reflexive distance-from-the self and is, therefore, unable to put forward a morally acceptable proposal of solidarity.},

  abstract = {We assessed evidence for a contextual effect of positive intergroup contact, whereby the effect of intergroup contact between social contexts (the between-level effect) on outgroup prejudice is greater than the effect of individual-level contact within contexts (the within-level effect). Across seven large-scale surveys (five cross-sectional and two longitudinal), using multilevel analyses, we found a reliable contextual effect. This effect was found in multiple countries, operationalizing context at multiple levels (regions, districts, and neighborhoods), and with and without controlling for a range of demographic and context variables. In four studies (three cross-sectional and one longitudinal) we showed that the association between context-level contact and prejudice was largely mediated by more tolerant norms. In social contexts where positive contact with outgroups was more commonplace, norms supported such positive interactions between members of different groups. Thus, positive contact reduces prejudice on a macrolevel, whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their social context, not merely on a microscale, via individuals' direct experience of positive contact with outgroup members. These findings reinforce the view that contact has a significant role to play in prejudice reduction, and has great policy potential as a means to improve intergroup relations, because it can simultaneously impact large numbers of people.},

The three languages vary significantly in their built-in assumptions about the nature of conflict, objectives of conflict resolution, and anticipation of what the termination of conflict entails. Such conceptual antinomies may hinder conflict resolution by impeding communication and frustrating the synchronization of negotiating moves. Nonnative speakers tend to speak in English but think in the mother tongue. Moreover, frontal negotiation is simply the point of contact among delegations whose consultation, decision making, drafting, and political processes are conducted in the native language. Israeli-Syrian negotiations since 1991 exemplify some dissonant expectations about conflict resolution across Hebrew and Arabic.},

  abstract = {Animals exploit the deformability of soft structures to move efficiently in complex natural environments. These soft structures are inherently compliant and enable large strains in components not typically found in robotics. Such capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. One goal in soft robotics is to endow robots with new, bioinspired features that permit morphologically adaptive interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review three key elements of bioinspired soft robots from a mechanics vantage point, namely, materials selection, actuation, and design. Soft materials are necessary for safe interaction and overall actuation of bioinspired robots. The intrinsic properties of materials in soft robots allow for an ``embodied intelligence'' that can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity in ways not possible with rigidbodied robots Finally, soft robotics can be combined with tissue engineering and synthetic biology to create bio-hybrid systems with unique sensing, dynamic response, and mobility. Bioinspired soft robots have the ability to also expedite the evolution of co-robots that can safely interact with humans.},

The authors track recent trends in contact theory to the emergence of extended, or indirect, forms of contact. These advances lead to an intriguing proposition: that simply imagining intergroup interactions can produce more positive perceptions of outgroups. The authors discuss empirical research supporting the imagined contact proposition and find it to be an approach that is at once deceptively simple and remarkably effective. Encouraging people to mentally simulate a positive intergroup encounter leads to improved outgroup attitudes and reduced stereotyping. It curtails intergroup anxiety and extends the attribution of perceivers' positive traits to others. The authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of imagined contact compared to conventional strategies, outline an agenda for future research, and discuss applications for policymakers and educators in their efforts to encourage more positive intergroup relations.},

However, there is no agreement on the categories in the mind of observers that enable them to recognize it, especially in widely differing domains such as fine art versus natural science. Concentration on socially useful products offers promise of a set of indicators that could be applied across domains: These include diagnosis, generation, germinality, and similar properties. Such indicators can be recognized with a substantial level of agreement by different observers, and can be used to judge both amount and kind of creativity. A universal aesthetic would offer perspectives on assessment of creativity, but would also improve communication among creative individuals and people such as critics, sponsors, clients, and the general public, as well as suggesting guidelines for teaching and learning activities and for better understanding of how to deal with misuse of creativity.},

Autistic children have difficulties in social interaction, communication and fantasy and imagination. As part of the project we run trials where autistic children are playing with a small, non-humanoid mobile robot that can engage children in simple interaction games. In our project we focus on the behavioural, rather than the affective level of robots used in therapy, cf. [12]. In this paper we first discuss in more detail varieties of interactions where one child, or two children simultaneously, play with a robot. We then outline a new research direction in the project which studies how a mobile robot can adapt t o individual children. Quantitative examples of activity levels in child-robot interactions are included. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions for adaptive robots in autism therapy.},

Two experiments were conducted using the ``minimal group paradigm'' to explore whether social identity theory influences trust formation and impressions of a robot. In Experiment 1, participants were allocated to either a ``robot'' or ``computer'' group, and then they played a cooperative visual tracking game with an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot as a partner. We hypothesised participants in the ``robot group'' would demonstrate intergroup bias by sitting closer to the robot (proxemics) and trusting the robot's suggested answers more frequently than their ``computer group'' counterparts. Experiment 2 used an almost identical procedure with a different set of participants; however, all participants were assigned to the ``robot group'' and thee different levels of anthropomorphic robot movement were manipulated. Our results suggest that intergroup bias and humanlike movement can significantly affect human-robot approach behaviour. Significant effects were found for trusting the robot's suggested answers with respect to task difficulty, but not for group membership or robot movement.},

An understanding of the lived body, viewed through the philosophical paradigms of theorists Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, will demonstrate the role of the corporeal schema and intercorporeality in an agent's interaction with the immediate environment and hence elucidate the limits of achieving a seamless remote interaction as good as the ``real thing.'' These considerations are fundamental for grounding the bioethical, legal, and epistemological issues that arise in remote interaction, particularly in the case of telesurgery.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal\textendash newborn contact enhances organization of the infant's physiological systems, including stress reactivity, autonomic functioning, and sleep patterns, and supports maturation of the prefrontal cortex and its ensuing effects on cognitive and behavioral control. Premature birth disrupts brain development and is associated with maternal separation and disturbances of contactsensitive systems. However, it is unknown whether the provision of maternal\textendash preterm contact can improve long-term functioning of these systems. Methods: We used the Kangaroo Care (KC) intervention and provided maternal\textendash newborn skin-to-skin contact to 73 premature infants for 14 consecutive days compared with 73 case-matched control subjects receiving standard incubator care. Children were then followed seven times across the first decade of life and multiple physiologic, cognitive, parental mental health, and mother\textendash child relational measures were assessed. Results: KC increased autonomic functioning (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and maternal attachment behavior in the postpartum period, reduced maternal anxiety, and enhanced child cognitive development and executive functions from 6 months to 10 years. By 10 years of age, children receiving KC showed attenuated stress response, improved RSA, organized sleep, and better cognitive control. RSA and maternal behavior were dynamically interrelated over time, leading to improved physiology, executive functions, and mother\textendash child reciprocity at 10 years. Conclusions: These findings are the first to demonstrate long-term effects of early touch-based intervention on children's physiologic organization and behavioral control and have salient implications for the care practices of premature infants. Results demonstrate the dynamic cascades of child physiological regulation and parental provisions in shaping developmental outcome and may inform the construction of more targeted early interventions.},

This approach seeks to examine critically how the social and material not only are entangled in what some call ``assemblages'' of the human and nonhuman, but also constitute the practices and knowings that comprise education. The chapter focuses in particular on methodologies for researching professional learning and knowing as sociomaterial practice. We draw examples from three doctoral studies-in-progress of learning in different settings: engineers in project teams developing environmental technologies, artists learning to balance multiple activities of art, market and bureaucracy, and health-care workers learning to implement a new technology in a paediatric diabetes clinic. These examples illustrate the insights as well as the dilemmas in working with sociomaterial approaches to make visible the materialities of learning. One key contribution here is the first hand voices of new researchers experimenting with these approaches. The methods and theories are difficult to apply, and the stories here help to reveal the strategies that student researchers adopted to work through the challenges of sociomaterial approaches.},

Methods Three issues are described here: (i) the limited attention paid to the importance of materiality \textendash{} objects, technologies, nature, etc. \textendash{} in questions of learning; (ii) the human-centric view of practice that fails to note the relations among social and material forces, and (iii) the conflicts between ideals of evidence-based standardised models and the sociomaterial contingencies of clinical practice. Discussion It is argued here that a socio-material approach to practice and learning offers important insights for medical education. This view is in line with a growing field of research in the materiality of everyday life, which embraces wide-ranging families of theory that can be only briefly mentioned in this short paper. The main premise they share is that social and material forces, culture, nature and technology, are enmeshed in everyday practice. Objects and humans act upon one another in ways that mutually transform their characteristics and activity. Examples from research in medical practice show how materials actively influence clinical practice, how learning itself is a material matter, how protocols are in fact temporary sociomaterial achievements, and how practices form unique and sometimes conflicting sociomaterial worlds, with diverse diagnostic and treatment approaches for the same thing. Conclusions This discussion concludes with implications for learning in practice. What is required is a shift from an emphasis on acquiring knowledge to participating more wisely in particular situations. This focus is on learning how to attune to minor material fluctuations and surprises, how to track one's own and others' effects on `intra-actions' and emerging effects, and how to improvise solutions.},

A meta-analysis (N = 32) examined the model of social influence in virtual environments (Blascovich, 2002) and investigated whether agents and avatars in virtual environments elicit different levels of social influence. Results indicated that perceived avatars produced stronger responses than perceived agents. Level of immersion (desktop vs. fully immersive), dependent variable type (subjective vs. objective), task type (competitive vs. cooperative vs. neutral), and actual control of the representation (human vs. computer) were examined as moderators. An interaction effect revealed that studies conducted on a desktop that used objective measures showed a stronger effect for agency than those that were conducted on a desktop but used subjective measures. Competitive and cooperative tasks showed greater agency effects than neutral tasks. Studies in which both conditions were actually human controlled showed greater agency effects than studies in which both conditions were actually computer controlled.

Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

It consists of a very complex mechanical structure that enables the hand to adapt and efficiently handle objects of various shapes, weights and textures. Today's prosthetic devices, struggling to provide similar functions, become overly complex and expensive. They are composed of multiple, precise parts, including miniaturised actuators and sensors as well as complex control, to satisfy the manipulation tasks required. In this paper we propose a soft pneumatic hand that adapts passively to the handled object due to its mechanical compliance. It is pressure driven and enables individual fingers to be controlled independently for dexterity or in groups when a synergistic finger movement is needed. The hand has a truly anatomical shape, is easy to replace and cheap in production. The design can be easily adjusted in terms of shape and size in order to fit each individual user. The paper presents the design, manufacturing technology, current control system and preliminary tests of the hand's capabilities.},

Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence\textemdash or minimizing variational free energy\textemdash we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes' optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton's principle of least action.},

  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

This model proposes that bias can'be reduced by factors that transform members' perceptions of group boundaries from ``us'' and ``them'' to a more inclusive ``we''. From this perspective, several features specified by the contact hypothesis (e.g. co-operative interaction) facilitate more harmonious intergroup interactions, at least in part, because they contribute to the development of a common ingroup identity. In this chapter, we describe laboratory and field studies that are supportive of the model; we also relate the model to earlier work on aversive racism.},

As a result of a large fiber peripheral neuropathy, the patient has lost the major functional aspects of his body schema, and thereby the possibility of normally unattended movement. To maintain control of posture and movement, he is forced to compensate for that loss by depending on the perceptual system of a body image that is modified in important respects. Both the conceptual distinction and the real relations that exist between body image and body schema are clarified by an examination of the specific limitations placed on motor control in this patient.}

This review examines two important concepts of self: the 'minimal self', a self devoid of temporal extension, and the 'narrative self', which involves personal identity and continuity across time. The notion of a minimal self is first clarified by drawing a distinction between the sense of self-agency and the sense of self-ownership for actions. This distinction is then explored within the neurological domain with specific reference to schizophrenia, in which the sense of self-agency may be disrupted. The convergence between the philosophical debate and empirical study is extended in a discussion of more primitive aspects of self and how these relate to neonatal experience and robotics. The second concept of self, the narrative self, is discussed in the light of Gazzaniga's left-hemisphere 'interpreter' and episodic memory. Extensions of the idea of a narrative self that are consistent with neurological models are then considered. The review illustrates how the philosophical approach can inform cognitive science and suggests that a two-way collaboration may lead to a more fully developed account of the self.},

In this paper we present the design and fabrication of a robust, fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator where its bend radius and bending axis can be mechanically-programed with a flexible, selectively-placed conformal covering that acts to mechanically constrain motion. Several soft actuators were fabricated and their displacement and force capabilities were measured experimentally and compared to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Finally, a prototype two-digit end-effector was designed and programmed with the conformal covering to shape match a rectangular object. We demonstrated improved gripping force compared to a pure bending actuator. We envision this approach enabling rapid customization of soft actuator function for grasping applications where the geometry of the task is known a priori.},

We investigate the mechanical behaviors of various woven fabrics and rib weft-knitted fabric structures, guiding us to design a thumb-abduction SFPA, a finger-flexion SFPA, and a finger-extension SFPA. We further develop a mathematical model to evaluate the influence of the geometric parameters on the blocked tip forces of the fingerflexion SFPAs and extension torques of the finger-extension SFPAs, which are also verified by the experimental results. We then integrate our SFPAs into a soft wearable assistive glove with a portable control system. The glove is finally tested on a healthy volunteer and a brachial plexus injury patient. The clinical evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our designed glove in assisting hand motions and grasping tasks.},

From the journal Neuropsychoanalysis (which based on its name I predict is a center of expertise in not understanding things): At Columbia's psychiatry department, I recently led a journal club for 15 PET and fMRI researhers, PhDs and MDs all, with well over \$10 million in NIH grants between us, and we tried to understand Friston's 2010 Nature Reviews Neuroscience paper \textendash{} for an hour and a half.

Our main focus concerns the similarity between users and avatars, a factor known as truthfulness. Our experiment requires the participants to control three avatars using a third-person perspective: a robot, a suit and their virtual doppelganger (virtual representation of the self). In order to analyze users' reactions and strategies, each task of the scenario of the virtual reality application can potentially affect the integrity of their characters. Our results revealed that ownership, one of the three factors of the sense of embodiment, is higher for the participants controlling their self-representation than with abstract representations. Furthermore, avatar visual fidelity seems to affect users' subjective experience, half of the panel reported having different behavior depending on the controlled character. Abstract representations allow the users to adopt more risky behaviors, while self-representations maintain a connection with the real world and encourage users to preserve the integrity of their avatar.},

We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.},

  abstract = {Objective Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR. Methods Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis. Results Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P{$<$}.0001) with homogeneity of distribution. Conclusion Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.},

While immersed in a virtual environment, participants listened to a persuasive communication from a digital representation of another student. The latter was actually an embodied agent (a computer-controlled digital representation of a human). Study 1 examined the extent to which gender of the virtual human, participant gender, and the agent's behavior affected attitude change. Results revealed gender-based ingroup favoritism in the form of greater attitude change for same gender virtual humans. Study 2 examined behavioral realism and agency beliefs; that is, whether participants believed the other to be an agent or an avatar (an online representation of an actual person). Results supported Blascovich and colleague's model of social influence within immersive virtual environments. Specifically, the prediction that virtual humans high in behavioral realism would be more influential than those low in behavioral realism was supported, but this effect was moderated by the gender of the virtual human and the research participant. Implications of these findings for the model are discussed.},

In both Study 1, conducted on a random sample of Israeli Jews (N = 103), and Study 2, conducted on a nationally diverse sample of Israeli Jews (N = 670), we experimentally test the effect of a unique approach to humanizing the outgroup based on empathy. Instead of requiring individuals to express empathy for outgroup suffering they might have caused, this approach requires an expression of empathy for suffering unrelated to the conflict between the groups. Results suggest that such an expression of empathy from one group member toward the other group can lead to ``reciprocal empathy'' which facilitates a greater willingness to accept the humanity of all members of the other group.},

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r\textendash{} = +0.26,with an experimental effect size of d\textendash{} = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors.},

This is not the case for the "agential realism" of Karen Barad, one of whose features is the view that entities emerge from their interactions rather than pre-existing them. This aspect of Barad's thought puts her at odds with the more traditional concept of realism found among the speculative realists. Yet Barad also rejects Descartes old taxonomical view that there must be two different kinds of entity: thought and dead matter. In abolishing this distinction, Barad is an ally of object-oriented philosophy even while opposing other forms of speculative realism. The second half of the essay criticizes Barad for conflating two entirely different senses of the word "atomism," leading to difficult consequences for her philosophy.},

  abstract = {This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member.These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.},

Therefore, it is assumed that the remote participants' turns are tended to decrease. It is said that addressee tends to be next speaker. Therefore, becoming addressee is previous step to become speaker and take turns. In order to make remote participant become addressee, proposed system recognized remote participant's non-verbal cues such as attention directions, nod motions and backchannels. Then, the system exaggerates the cues and expresses them as the telepresence robot's motions.},

A virtual human representing an outgroup member (a Palestinian) interacted with 60 Jewish Israeli participants in an experimental study. We manipulated postural mimicry by the virtual interaction partner during a conversation about a sensitive conflict issue. Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants' feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup. The use of virtual\textendash human interactions in obtaining this effect reveals the still widely unexplored potential of technology-enhanced conflict resolution.},

In two studies, Jewish-Israelis watched a 360\textdegree{} VR scene depicting an Israeli-Palestinian confrontation from different POVs\textendash outgroup's, ingroup's while imagining outgroup perspective or ingroup's without imagined perspective-taking. Participants immersed in the outgroup's POV, but not those who imagined the outgroup's perspective, perceived the Palestinians more positively than those immersed in the ingroup's POV. Moreover, participants in the outgroup's POV perceived the Palestinian population in general more favorably and judged a real-life ingroup transgression more strictly than those in the ingroup's POV, even five months after VR intervention. Results suggest that VR can promote conflict resolution by enabling effective perspective-taking.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the ``ultimate empathy machine'' since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.},

  abstract = {In keeping with the focus of this special section, we concentrate initially on some of the problems of autonomist Marxist concepts such as `immaterial labour', `affective labour' and `precarity' for understanding work in the cultural industries. We then briefly review some relevant media theory (John Thompson's notion of mediated quasi-interaction) and some key recent sociological research on cultural labour (especially work by Andrew Ross and Laura Grindstaff, the latter drawing on Hochschild's concept of emotional labour), which we believe may be more useful than autonomist concepts in developing empirically informed critique. The main body of the article then consists of an ethnographic account of working on one particular television programme, an account that aims to build on these theoretical debates. We analyse how the power to provide exposure or not to individuals in the talent show genre in contemporary television (a feature that derives from the symbolic power of producers to make texts that are then circulated to massive numbers of people) and disputes between commissioners and independent producers about how best to go about doing so (an organizational issue) are registered in the form of stress, anxiety and sometimes poor working relations among project teams of young television researchers (a matter of working conditions and experiences). We especially focus on how additional pressures are borne by these workers because of the requirements to undertake emotional labour, involving the handling of strong emotions on the part of talent show contributors, and to maintain good working relations in short-term project work, requirements generated by the need to ensure future employment. Ultimately, then, we support the view that creative work is `precarious' \textendash{} but we go beyond the generalizations involved in concepts such as immaterial labour and affective labour to show the specific ways in which precariousness is registered and negotiated in the lives of young workers in one industry.},

The flexibility of pneumatic artificial muscles releases us from the spatially strict design that is necessary for rigid mechanical mechanisms. It could actualize compact mechanisms consisting of fewer components. The thin McKibben muscles are more flexible than conventional McKibben muscles. Authors succeeded in manufacturing novel soft mechanisms that are composed of only woven artificial muscles and strings. We called this mechanism active textile. The structure is uniformed with woven artificial muscles; nevertheless, the forms and movements of mechanisms are diverse. We aim to establish a design method for these active textiles. Thus, we should know how the expansion of muscles affects the behavior of mechanisms. We reported that deformations of active textiles are changed by woven structures. In addition to that, wefts' characteristics such as cross-sectional shape, bending stiffness and elasticity determine the characteristic of a textile. Deformations of active textiles are caused by the contraction and the expansion of thin McKibben muscles. In this paper, authors focus the contraction in the wefts direction of active textile that is caused by the expansion of thin McKibben muscles as warps. We fabricated three different active textiles that made of thin McKibben muscle and three different strings. We observed experimentally the contraction behavior in the weft direction of active textiles: the contraction characteristics the relationship between applied pressure and contraction ratio and the relationship between applied pressure and contraction force. As result, the contraction characteristics of active textiles are changed by using different strings as wefts. Maximum contraction force is caused by using thin strings, and the hysteresis of the active textile that made of elastic strings is small.},

In the present investigation, interpersonal-disgust sensitivity (e.g., not wanting to wear clean used clothes or to sit on a warm seat vacated by a stranger) in particular predicted negative attitudes toward immigrants, foreigners, and socially deviant groups, even after controlling for concerns with contracting disease. The mechanisms underlying the link between interpersonal disgust and attitudes toward immigrants were explored using a path model. As predicted, the effect of interpersonaldisgust sensitivity on group attitudes was indirect, mediated by ideological orientations (social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism) and dehumanizing perceptions of the out-group. The effects of social dominance orientation on group attitudes were both direct and indirect, via dehumanization. These results establish a link between disgust sensitivity and prejudice that is not accounted for by fear of infection, but rather is mediated by ideological orientations and dehumanizing group representations. Implications for understanding and reducing prejudice are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a peripheral empathy-evoking robotic conversation companion, Kip1. The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote nonaggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to-human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.},

To illustrate our design approach, we discuss four case studies: a social head for a robotic musician, a robotic speaker dock listening companion, a desktop telepresence robot, and a service robot performing assistive and communicative tasks. We then relate our approach to the design of non-anthropomorphic robots and robotic objects, a design strategy that could facilitate the feasibility of real-world human-robot interaction.},

In my analysis, I contextualise PewDiePie's own comments and YouTube's publications into the history of Internet culture and introduce the development of YouTube into a neoliberalist sphere. I illustrate how neoliberal ideology is now implemented on three levels on YouTube: through creating an illusion of intimacy between a creator and his/her fans, through the promise of equal opportunity on YouTube and through a neoliberalist interpretation of the marketplace-of-ideas principle. The analysis reveals how YouTube's policies and practices as ideological choices contribute to the normalisation of racism on social media.},

In two simultaneously running loops, a more reflective process is balanced with a more affective process. If human interference is detected behind the machine, Robot-Mediated Communication commences, which basically follows CMC assumptions; if human interference remains undetected, Human-Robot Communication comes into play, holding the robot for an autonomous social actor. The more emotionally aroused a robot user is, the more likely they develop an affective relationship with what actually is a machine. The main contribution of this paper is an integration of Computer-Mediated Communication, Human-Robot Communication, and Media Psychology, outlining a full-blown theory of robot communication connected to friendship formation, accounting for communicative features, modes of processing, as well as psychophysiology.},

This paper discusses CMC theories in confrontation with observations and research data gained from human-robot communication. As a result, I argue for an addition to CMC theorizing when the robot as a medium itself becomes the communication partner.

Then this Mel-spectrogram is fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). For video signals, some representative frames from a video segment are extracted and fed to the CNN. The outputs of the two CNNs are fused using two consecutive extreme learning machines (ELMs). The output of the fusion is given to a support vector machine (SVM) for final classification of the emotions. The proposed system is evaluated using two audio\textendash visual emotional databases, one of which is Big Data. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system involving the CNNs and the ELMs.},

With the evolution of artificial intelligence, many pieces of research have made further progresses in adaptive and robust control. The survey reveals that the latest research in deep learning and reinforcement learning has paved the way for highly complex tasks to be performed by robots. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and transfer learning in robot control are discussed in detail.

In this article, I explore this question by drawing on my own experiences of reconsidering essentialist and representationalist assumptions, and becoming a sociomaterial researcher. My exploration draws on my experiences of conducting a qualitative longitudinal case study at the Swedish Migration Board. Specifically, I show what it can mean to `invite materiality' into interviews, examine the conditions of possibility to become in certain ways by tracing the genealogy of practices, and engage with data relationally rather than categorically. By accounting for my experience of working through these practices, I aim to develop and articulate an understanding of what the ontological position underlying a sociomaterial approach implies for epistemology, and of how we can act (or, rather, intra-act) more creatively and responsibly as sociomaterial researchers. Moreover, I highlight differences in the kinds of knowledge that a sociomaterial approach grounded in relational and performative onto-epistemologies, as opposed to a socio-material approach, grounded in critical realism, produce about the unfolding of organizational practices\textemdash specifically, the practices unfolding in the reception area of the Swedish Migration Board. The paper contributes to the current debate on sociomaterial approaches, and in particular to the development of practices available to draw upon for researchers taking a sociomaterial approach.},

We show how translation, rather than being reduced to a network of human intentions and actions governing the transformation of organizational practices, can instead be understood as a historically contingent, situated flow of mundane everyday work practices through which social and material translators simultaneously become translated, conditioned to be and act in certain ways. We show how prior actor-centric accounts of translation of management ideas can be understood as performative consequences of a conceptual vocabulary inherited from Callon and Latour. Contrasting this, the non-actor-centric vocabulary of social anthropologist Tim Ingold allows us to background the intentional human actor and foreground the flow of mundane, situated practices. In adopting this vocabulary, we capture how the flow of practices conditions subjects and objects to become enacted as well as act, and develop an understanding of translation as occurring within, rather than distinct from, these practices. In essence, our novel view of translation emphasizes how management ideas are radically unstable, and subject to alteration through the flow of practices rather than as a result of deliberate implementation efforts.},

  abstract = {This video shows a continuing work of the glove puppet robot presented before. The major improvement from the previous work is to mount the 9-DOF mechanism, which mimicking a glove puppet manipulation, on a two-wheel mobile platform. The platform provides agile movements of the robot but itself is an unstable system. Hence, a self-balancing controller is implemented by considering the motion as well as configuration variation of the upper body (the 9-DOF mechanism). The control law utilizes the principle of computed torque method with online identification of related parameters using various sensors including an accelerometer. The incline angle is obtained by fusing a gyroscope and a tilt sensor. Under the balancing control, the forward motion of the robot is achieved by giving a desired tilt angle profile. To minimize the footprint of electronics, the controller is implemented using an 8-bit single-chip microcontroller. Further, to enhance the interaction capability of the system, a simple gesture coding using dynamic time warping identification method with Markov model is implemented for the data glove to recognize the puppet gesture by human hand.},

  abstract = {Humans, more than any other species, have been altering their paths of development by creating new material forms and by opening up to new possibilities of material engagement. That is, we become constituted through making and using technologies that shape our minds and extend our bodies. We make things which in turn make us. This ongoing dialectic has long been recognised from a deep-time perspective. It also seems natural in the present in view of the ways new materialities and digital ecologies increasingly envelop our everyday life and thinking. Still the basic idea that humans and things are co-constituted continues to challenge us, raising important questions about the place and meaning of materiality and technical change in human life and evolution. This paper bridging perspectives from postphenomenology and Material Engagement Theory (MET) is trying to attain better understanding about these matters. Our emphasis falls specifically on the human predisposition for technological embodiment and creativity. We re-approach the notion Homo faber in a way that, on the one hand, retains the power and value of this notion to signify the primacy of making or creative material engagement in human life and evolution and, on the other hand, reclaims the notion from any misleading connotations of human exceptionalism (other animals make and use tools). In particular, our use of the term Homo faber refers to the special place that this ability has in the evolution and development of our species. The difference that makes the difference is not just the fact that we make things. The difference that makes the difference is the recursive effect that the things that we make and our skills of making seem to have on human becoming. We argue that we are Homo faber not just because we make things but also because we are made by them.},

  abstract = {Material Engagement Theory (MET) is currently driving a conceptual change in the archaeology of mind. Drawing upon the dictates of enactivism and active externalism, it specifically calls for a radical reconceptualization of mind and material culture. Unpersuaded by the common assumption that cognition is brain-bound, Malafouris argues in favour of a process ontology that situates thinking in action. In granting ontological primacy to material engagement, MET seeks to illuminate the emergence of human ways of thinking through the practical effects of the material world. Considering that this is a characteristic example of a pragmatic take on cognition, this contemporary theoretical platform appears to share a lot with pragmatism. As of late, scholars working at the intersection of philosophy, semiotics, and cognitive science have made important steps towards the rapprochement between pragmatism and externalism. Looking to contribute to this growing corpus of work, the present paper focuses on MET's relation to the pragmatism of Peirce, Dewey, and Mead. Having elsewhere recognized the overlap and complementarity between Malafouris' and Peirce's theories in particular, I developed a pragmatic and enactive theory of cognitive semiotics that is suitably geared to trace the nature, emergence, and evolution of material signs. Therefore, besides noting some obvious historical connections, I hereby aim to establish (at least part of) the theoretical backdrop upon which this composite theory is supposed to function, while also exploring new potential avenues. Given that this cognitive semiotic framework can be seen as a pragmatic extension of Malafouris' enactivist approach to archaeology, the current paper delves into MET's theoretical underpinnings, seeking to complement its working hypotheses and concepts with philosophical notions and ideas advanced long ago. This synthesis ultimately concludes with a call for the reconceptualization of `representation' as a heuristic concept.},

Building on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and social neuroscience models we developed an eight-week dialogue group-intervention for youth growing up amidst intractable conflict. Eighty-eight Israeli-Jewish and Arab-Palestinian adolescents (16-18years) were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Before (T1) and after (T2) intervention, one-on-one conflict interaction with outgroup member were videotaped, oxytocin levels assayed, attitudes self-reported, and youth interviewed regarding national conflict. We tested the hypothesis that dialogue intervention would enhance empathic behavior and increase oxytocin levels following interaction with outgroup member. Intervention increased youth perspective-taking on national conflict. Oxytocin increased from T1 to T2 only for adolescents undergoing intervention who improved perspective taking in the process. Structural equation modelling charted three pathways to behavioral empathy toward outgroup member at T2; via endogenous oxytocin, empathic cognitions, and dialogue intervention; however, an alternative model without the intervention arm was non-significant. Our findings highlight the important role of empathy in programs for inter-group reconciliation and support evolutionary models on the precarious balance between the neurobiology of affiliation and the neurobiology of outgroup derogation.},

Anthropology, by contrast, is an inquiry into the conditions and possibilities of human life in the world. Anthropology and ethnography may have much to contribute to one another, but their aims and objectives are different. Ethnography is an end in itself; it is not a means to anthropological ends. Moreover, participant observation is an anthropological way of working, not a method of ethnographic data collection. To study anthropology is to study with people, not to make studies of them; such study is not so much ethnographic as educational. An anthropological education gives us the intellectual means to speculate on the conditions of human life in this world, without our having to pretend that our arguments are distillations of the practical wisdom of those among whom we have worked. Our job is to correspond with them, not to speak for them. Only by acknowledging the speculative nature of anthropological inquiry can we both make our voices heard and properly engage with other disciplines. And only then can we lead the way in forging the universities of the future.},

  abstract = {Indirect forms of intergroup contact, such as extended and vicarious contact, are thought to provide a promising alternative to direct contact, but very few studies have compared the effectiveness of these two types of contact to confirm this claim. Furthermore, Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, and Ropp (1997) postulated, but did not test, that the usefulness of extended (or vicarious) over direct contact lies in these forms of indirect contact being likely to elicit less anxiety and more group salience at the time of the interaction, both of which are beneficial for contact. The present paper reports two experiments comparing the effects of direct and vicarious contact on: (i) outgroup attitudes and anxiety for future contact both immediately after contact (posttest) as well as a week later (delayed posttest), and (ii) their elicited interaction-induced anxiety and group salience. Both studies were conducted in Cyprus, with Greek Cypriot participants and the Turkish Cypriot community as the outgroup. Results did not support Wright et al.'s postulations. They furthermore showed that direct contact had a relative advantage over vicarious contact in leading to more positive outgroup attitudes at posttest, but that attitudes reverted to pretest levels for both conditions at delayed posttest. Vicarious, unlike direct, contact, did, however, lead to a persistent reduction of anxiety for future contact, thus suggesting that the greatest utility of indirect forms of contact may lie in their emotionally preparing individuals for subsequent face-to-face interactions.},

We used the method of qualitative case study, analyzing the audiovisual records of essays and presentation, the software solution developed in Unity 3D, and the data collected from a focus group interview with puppeteers. This study identified as weaknesses of our system: the hand tracking unreliability and the lack of tactile feedback, causing discomfort in experienced puppeteering professionals. As strengthens of the system, we found that the technology aroused interest because of its potential for expanding the options of tools available for popular puppetry shows creation in current times.},

While schools of thought differ significantly in how they position themselves vis-\`a-vis the subjectivist-objectivist axis, few would deny that the delineation of the interpretive task must attend to the embodied character of human cognition. Taking such a broader framework as a starting point, I will tackle a specific aspect of this problematic by examining Foucault's conception of subjectivity and truth as it relates to issues of epistemology, moral responsibility, and ask\=esis. As I will argue, Foucault's ``art of living'' persuasively highlights the background or ``unthought'' aspects of hermeneutics. My particular approach will be to connect Foucault's brand of virtue epistemology with a broadly post-Heideggerian conception of engaged agency, and in so doing spotlight some assumptions as to what ``having truth'' or ``arriving at it'' might mean in the context of hermeneutical practice and being.},

We demonstrate that the proposed model is able to transfer the knowledge of speaker variability learned by the discriminatively-trained speaker encoder to the multispeaker TTS task, and is able to synthesize natural speech from speakers unseen during training. We quantify the importance of training the speaker encoder on a large and diverse speaker set in order to obtain the best generalization performance. Finally, we show that randomly sampled speaker embeddings can be used to synthesize speech in the voice of novel speakers dissimilar from those used in training, indicating that the model has learned a high quality speaker representation.},

A key feature of the Wii is its motion-sensing capability that empowers players to manipulate and interact with items on-screen via movement. The present study examined the effects of video game players' self-construal on parasocial interaction with their avatars and feelings of self-presence. In this study, parasocial interaction was operationally defined as the extent of game players' interpersonal involvement with their avatar and the extent to which game players perceive themselves as interacting with the avatar. Self-presence was defined as the degree to which video game players feel as if their avatar on the screen were their real self. Based on an experiment, the study discovered that game players with high interdependent self-construal showed closer parasocial interaction and higher level of self-presence than those with low interdependent self-construal. Results also showed that self-presence mediated the effects of interdependent self-construal on the parasocial relationship with game players' avatars. Thus, the study discovered an important individual difference factor, interdependent self-construal, affecting the degree to which people form a parasocial relationship with their virtual self that is visually manifested in the form of an avatar. In addition, the present study added empirical evidence about the mediating role played by self-presence in avatar-based video games.},

  abstract = {The present study explores the antecedents of the antinormative hostile communication of emotion, termed flaming, in the context of computer-mediated negotiation. We find that flaming is associated with anger directed toward the negotiating context; this can occur when a negotiator becomes frustrated due to problems with communication channel characteristics or due to uncertainty surrounding the negotiation task. We also find that flaming is associated with anger directed toward a negotiator's partner, which can occur when a negotiator perceives that the partner is being unfair. We find further that anger totally mediates the relationships between flaming and its antecedents. These findings provide the basis to argue that anger reduction can effectively decrease flaming, independent of the existence of flaming antecedents, such as unfairness. We therefore provide suggestions that can help with the reduction of anger in such circumstances.},

Within this context, this work sets out to investigate the factors necessary for courses mediated by technology to attain their pedagogical objectives. Additionally, the study examines how subjects that develop hard and soft skills differ in a technology-mediated setting. The results show that the teacher's digital competence on the technological platform and the metacognitive support available in the digital environment are significant factors for a course to attain its pedagogical objectives successfully. Lastly, the study revealed that hard skill disciplines, when they migrate to technology-mediated environments, are more likely to fail to achieve their educational goals than soft skill disciplines subject to the same migration.},

Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot's repair interventions increased the groups' awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups' tendency to suppress the conflict. These findings suggest that repair heightened awareness of a normative violation. Overall, our results provide support for the idea that robots can aid team functioning by regulating core team processes such as conflict.},

In this paper I argue that, thirty years after the publication of the Theory of Communicative Action, this thesis remains compelling. However, while Habermas offers a functionalist explanation of reification, his normative criticism of it remains largely implicit: he never explains what is wrong with reification from the perspective of the people whose social relations are reified. As a result, Habermas cannot explain why only some forms of colonization lead to reification effects. In particular, he suggests that reification effects result from the juridification of communicatively structured domains of action but not from the commodification of labour power. I criticize this argument and suggest that if the normative dimension of the colonization thesis is made explicit, a more nuanced explanation of reification becomes possible.},

The rules of the study required players in dyads to reach mutual agreement on every action in the game. Results indicated that 19 out of 25 dyads resolved the conflict in the game as opposed to 16 out of 50 single players. In addition, players in dyads took more political actions and less security actions than single players did. Finally, players in dyads preferred to focus more on political actions than on security actions in the game. The abovementioned results point out three key implications for peace education. First, PeaceMaker reduces the tension and the charged atmosphere between Jewish and Palestinian players. Second, the game should be played in dyads and not singly. Finally, dyads should be comprised of a Jewish player and a Palestinian player in order to challenge their interaction and game behavior.},

It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model redefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms of existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.},

Research has shown that CMC influences the attributions that individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these attributions. However, little is known about the impact that attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that selfdisclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock's (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for CMC's unique impact on the relationship between selfdisclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.},

In physical spatial collaboration such as team dancing, theatrical performance, and team sport, one's behavior should be in accord with the partner's; the relative position in distance and in direction is critically important all the time even when moving. To realize remote physical spatial collaboration, achieving the shared recognition of positional relationship is one of the key issues. In this paper, we propose a setup between two remote sites where each collaborator immerses in the other remote site by a telepresence robot situated in the other site. The telepresence robot is a wheeled platform with a camera attached at man's eye height. It moves in response to the remote user's position and orientation and enables the user to get the first-person view video through a head-mounted display. By using two telepresence robots from both sites, both collaborators can recognize the partner being in front of him/her and can grasp the distance and the orientation of the partner in remote site. In the proposed setup, users can grasp the positional relationship as accurate and quick as the existing fixed views including the bird's-eye view.},

The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.},

We conceptualize online contact as occurring through users' comments online, an easy and accessible venue for intergroup encounters. We test two forms of online contact: encountering an outgroup member directly (direct online contact) or through an ingroup member (extended online contact) and their effects on outgroup attitudes, here various forms of threat and social distance. We also examine the emotional mechanisms through which these effects emerge. We rely on an online experiment (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 396) testing online contact with two distinct outgroups, an undocumented immigrant or a gay person. Compared to the control, direct online contact decreased perceived threat and social distance toward gays and lesbians, but not toward undocumented immigrants. Direct online contact improved attitudes toward both outgroups through positive and negative emotions, whereas extended online contact reduced negative emotions, improving attitudes towards undocumented immigrants. We discuss theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these findings.},

In all these approaches, the body is viewed as a locus for experience and knowledge. If the body is a source of subjective knowledge, then it can also become an important means of creating ontological categories of self and society. The materiality of human representations within art traditions, then, can be interpreted as providing a means for contextualizing and aestheticizing the body in order to produce a symbolic and structural knowledge category.

In this paper, we describe current design practices, and reflect on the design approaches that characterize avatars and avatar systems in this emerging commercial sector. To investigate design approaches to avatar systems and their impact on communication and interaction with people within this medium, we interviewed industry experts associated with a range of platforms including Rec Room, AltspaceVR, High Fidelity, VRChat, Anyland, and Mozilla Hubs. In analyzing the ways that design choices shape embodied experience, we map design approaches to avatar systems in this evolving landscape and make preliminary claims about the impact of these varying design approaches.},

  abstract = {Prior research with preschool children has established that dialogic or active book reading is an effective method for expanding young children's vocabulary. In this exploratory study, we asked whether similar benefits are observed when a robot engages in dialogic reading with preschoolers. Given the established effectiveness of active reading, we also asked whether this effectiveness was critically dependent on the expressive characteristics of the robot. For approximately half the children, the robot's active reading was expressive; the robot's voice included a wide range of intonation and emotion (Expressive). For the remaining children, the robot read and conversed with a flat voice, which sounded similar to a classic text-to-speech engine and had little dynamic range (Flat). The robot's movements were kept constant across conditions. We performed a verification study using Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that the Expressive robot was viewed as significantly more expressive, more emotional, and less passive than the Flat robot. We invited 45 preschoolers with an average age of 5 years who were either English Language Learners (ELL), bilingual, or native English speakers to engage in the reading task with the robot. The robot narrated a story from a picture book, using active reading techniques and including a set of target vocabulary words in the narration. Children were post-tested on the vocabulary words and were also asked to retell the story to a puppet. A subset of 34 children performed a second story retelling 4-6 weeks later. Children reported liking and learning from the robot a similar amount in the Expressive and Flat conditions. However, as compared to children in the Flat condition, children in the Expressive condition were more concentrated and engaged as indexed by their facial expressions; they emulated the robot's story more in their story retells; and they told longer stories during their delayed retelling. Furthermore, children who responded to the robot's active reading questions were more likely to correctly identify the target vocabulary words in the Expressive condition than in the Flat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that children may benefit more from the expressive robot than from the flat robot.},

For this purpose, we built Keepon, which is a small creature-like robot, and observed how autistic and typically-developing children (2\textendash 4 years old) interacted with it. Keepon was placed in their playrooms just as one of their toys, and tele-controlled by a human operator in a remote room; the children naturally and spontaneously showed various communicative actions to Keepon. From the longitudinal observations for more than two years (over 100 sessions of 3 hours) in a remedial institute and a preschool, we found that Keepon's comprehensive appearance and predictable responses gave the children a playful and relaxed mood, in which they spontaneously engaged in dyadic interaction with Keepon, and also that the typically-developing children and some of the autistic children extended the interaction into triadic one, where Keepon worked as the pivot of interpersonal play with their caregivers. Each child showed a different style and a different unfolding of interaction over time, which tell us a ``story'' of his or her personality and developmental profile, which is informative for the caregiver and the nursing staff to understand the child better, and is now being utilized for improving the remedial and educational services.},

In this paper, an overview of the various systems, application areas, and challenges found in the literature concerning mobile robotic telepresence is provided. The survey also proposes a set terminology for the field as there is currently a lack of standard terms for the different concepts related to MRP systems. Further, this paper provides an outlook on the various research directions for developing and enhancing mobile robotic telepresence systems per se, as well as evaluating the interaction in laboratory and field settings. Finally, the survey outlines a number of design implications for the future of mobile robotic telepresence systems for social interaction.},

  abstract = {Although the act of dehumanizing an outgroup is a pervasive and potent intergroup process that drives discrimination and conflict, no formal research has examined the consequences of being dehumanized by an outgroup\textemdash that is, ``metadehumanization.'' Across 10 studies (N ϭ 3,440) involving several real-world conflicts spanning 3 continents, we provide the first empirical evidence that metadehumanization (a) plays a central role in outgroup aggression that is (b) mediated by outgroup dehumanization, and (c) distinct from metaprejudice. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrate experimentally that Americans who learn that Arabs (Study 1a) or Muslims (Study 1b) blatantly dehumanize Americans are more likely to dehumanize that outgroup in return; by contrast, experimentally increasing outgroup dehumanization did not increase metadehumanization (Study 1c). Using correlational data, Study 2 documents indirect effects of metadehumanization on Americans' support for aggressive policies toward Arabs (e.g., torture) via Arab dehumanization. In the context of Hungarians and ethnic minority Roma, Study 3 shows that the pathway for Hungarians from metadehumanization to aggression through outgroup dehumanization holds controlling for outgroup prejudice. Study 4 examines Israelis' metaperceptions with respect to Palestinians, showing that: (a) feeling dehumanized (i.e., metadehumanization) is distinct from feeling disliked (i.e., metaprejudice), and (b) metadehumanization uniquely influences aggression through outgroup dehumanization, controlling for metaprejudice. Studies 5a and 5b explore Americans' metaperceptions regarding ISIS and Iran. We document a dehumanization-specific pathway from metadehumanization to aggressive attitudes and behavior that is distinct from the path from metaprejudice through prejudice to aggression. In Study 6, American participants learning that Muslims humanize Americans (i.e., metahumanization) humanize Muslims in turn. Finally, Study 7 experimentally contrasts metadehumanization and metahumanization primes, and shows that resulting differences in outgroup dehumanization are mediated by (a) perceived identity threat, and (b) a general desire to reciprocate the outgroup's perceptions of the ingroup. In summary, our research outlines how and why metadehumanization contributes to cycles of ongoing violence and animosity, providing direction for future research and policy.},

Recent invented media resemble cute animals or imaginary creatures that quickly attract attention. However, such appearances could distort tele-communications because they are different from human beings. This paper studies the effect on the speaker's personality that is transmitted through physical media by regarding appearances as a function that transmits the speaker's information. Although communication media's capability to transmit information reportedly influences conversations in many aspects, the effect of appearances remains unclear. To reveal the effect of appearance, we compared three appearances of communication media: stuffed-bear teleoperated robot, human-like teleoperated robot, and video chat. Our results show that communication media whose appearance greatly differs from that of the speaker distorts the personality perceived by interlocutors. This paper suggests that the design of the appearance of physical communication media needs to be carefully selected.},

  abstract = {The aim of our study is to investigate systems for supporting remote instruction via a mobile robot. In the real world, instructions are typically given through words and body orientations such as head movements, which make it possible to project others' actions. Projectability is an important resource in organizing multiple actions among multiple participants in co-ordination with one another. It can likewise be said that in the case of robot-human collaboration, it is necessary to design a robot's head so that a local participant can project the robot's (and remote person's) actions. GestureMan is a robot that is designed to support such projectability properties. It is argued that a remote controlled mobile robot, designed as a communication medium, makes relevant dual ecologies: ecology at a remote (robot operator's) site and at a local participant's (robot's) site. In order to design a robot as a viable communication medium, it is essential to consider how these ecologies can be mediated and supported.},

In this work we propose combining two independent prediction models. A continuous model predicts the upcoming end of the turn in order to generate gaze aversion and fillers as turn-taking cues. This prediction is done while the user is speaking, so turn-taking can be done with little silence between turns, or even overlap. Once a speech recognition result has been received at a later time, a second model uses the lexical information to decide if or when the turn should actually be taken. We constructed the continuous model using the speaker's prosodic features as inputs and evaluated its online performance. We then conducted a subjective experiment in which we implemented our model in an android robot and asked participants to compare it to one without turn-taking cues, which produces a response when a speech recognition result is received. We found that using both gaze aversion and a filler was preferred when the continuous model correctly predicted the upcoming end of turn, while using only gaze aversion was better if the prediction was wrong.},

Unfortunately, the use of antibiotics selects for resistance at answering scale. The turn to the study of antibiotic resistance in microbiology and medicine is examined, focusing on the realization that individual therapies targeted at single pathogens in individual bodies are environmental events affecting bacterial evolution far beyond bodies. In turning to biological manifestations of antibiotic use, sciences fathom material outcomes of their own previous concepts. Archival work with stored soil and clinical samples produces a record described here as `the biology of history': the physical registration of human history in bacterial life. This account thus foregrounds the importance of understanding both the materiality of history and the historicity of matter in theories and concepts of life today.},

  abstract = {In order to enable the widespread use of robots in home and office environments, systems with natural interaction capabilities have to be developed. A prerequisite for natural interaction is the robot's ability to automatically recognize when and how long a person's attention is directed towards it for communication. As in open environments several persons can be present simultaneously, the detection of the communication partner is of particular importance. In this paper we present an attention system for a mobile robot which enables the robot to shift its attention to the person of interest and to maintain attention during interaction. Our approach is based on a method for multi-modal person tracking which uses a pan-tilt camera for face recognition, two microphones for sound source localization, and a laser range finder for leg detection. Shifting of attention is realized by turning the camera into the direction of the person which is currently speaking. From the orientation of the head it is decided whether the speaker addresses the robot. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an evaluation. In addition, qualitative results from the performance of the robot at the exhibition part of the ICVS'03 are provided.},

This model was applied using both the manufacturer's data and experimental data to extrapolate the efficiency and flow rate of the pump which can then be used to optimize the dimensions of the actuator based on the target payload. It is then demonstrated that OV-PAMs can be used as a lightweight, low-cost, portable and powerful actuation solution paired with either batteries or solar panels and lightweight pumps. By optimizing its parameters, it will be possible to implement this actuator for the automation of low-cost off-grid operations and for field robots that can collaborate with humans.},

Moreover, some of the designs presented in this article can lift large loads with large contraction ratios at extremely low vacuum pressure (\&10 kPa). This actuator consists of a sealed origami film chamber connecting a polygonal top and bottom plate with evenly spaced transversal reinforcements that prevent the chamber from contracting laterally at certain points of the actuator under vacuum pressure. As vacuum pressure is applied, both a tension force in the walls and a vertical force on the bottom plate of the actuator generate a large contractile force, and the force on the bottom plate can produce a consistent force throughout the entire motion. A quasistatic analytical model was developed that can accurately predict the behavior of the actuator and that can be used for actuator design. OV-PAMs are lightweight, have large contractile forces throughout their entire motion and large contraction ratios. It can also produce large forces at low pressures with large cross-sectional areas. Their versatility could make them well suited for a wide range of applications. They could take us closer to a future where robots can cooperate with humans to shape a better future.},

To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model that scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique that shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.},

It begins by providing a brief overview of the sociomaterial perspective on organizational practices and considers why this perspective holds great appeal at this point in time. I then engage with Mutch's (2013) critique of the agential realist foundation upon which most current discussions of sociomateriality are constructed to highlight what practical problems are generated when authors attempt to map agential realism's philosophical discussion onto empirical phenomena. Next, I attempt to make explicit what Mutch leaves implicit in his paper: how building studies of sociomateriality on the theoretical foundation offered by critical realism can, potentially, overcome some of the practical problems created by a footing on agential realism. Finally, I push Mutch's arguments one step further to compare what practical consequences arise when researchers attempt to construct studies of sociomateriality on either of these two theoretical foundations. I suggest that there are important implications for what one can study, how one can study it, and how scholars can contribute to theory on technology and organizing based on the theoretical foundation they choose to build upon.},

We provide evidence for a set of phenomena characteristic of the organization of ``video-in-interaction'': (a) mobile and Skype video calls are patterned, often alternating between a ``talking heads'' arrangement, in which both participants are on-screen and facing the camera, and moments in which they are producing various shots of their environment in line with their current interactional purposes; (b) openings occur almost always in the talking heads arrangement; (c) the video images on either side are produced and expected to be scrutinized with respect to their relevance to the ongoing interaction; (d) the talking heads arrangement is oriented to a default mode of interaction, with the implication that when there is nothing else relevant to show, the participants should show themselves on-screen; (e) in multiparty interactions, the party who is handling the video communication apparatus has an obligation to put other speakers on-screen when they talk, and the video callers orient to their appearance on-screen as making a distinctive participation status relevant. We show how these phenomena all derive from an orientation toward a single maxim, ``put the face of the current speaker on-screen,'' which plays a foundational role in the organization of video-in-interaction and its articulation with that of talk-in-interaction.},

  abstract = {Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90\% of their initial lengths, generate stresses of {$\sim$}600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg\textemdash all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.}

Using the 2012 American National Election Studies, we find that the measurement of feeling thermometers is not exactly comparable between face-to-face and Web surveys. Face-to-face respondents tend to provide warmer feelings, while Web respondents give relatively more reliable responses in comparison. In both survey modes, respondents are most likely to select the response options that are verbally labeled although the effect is more striking in face-to-face than Web survey. The item nonresponse between these two modes does not differ in a meaningful way. This study ends by discussing future research directions on feeling thermometer questions.},

Given that both a change in movement behavior and social behavior are an objective in the contexts of aging-in-place, neurocognitive and neurophysical rehabilitation, and depression, these key mechanisms should also be included in the interaction with social companion robots in therapy and care.

The Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient is the most common type of correlation; however, the Pearson correlation coefficient may not be applicable in all cases. There are many types of correlation coefficient. The correct choice of correlation coefficient depends on the classification of the independent variable (X) and dependent variable (Y). Data are classified into one of three types: quantitative, nominal and ordinal. This writing explains various types of correlations on the basis of X-by-Y data type combination.},

Sessions included an international, gender balanced, cross generational group of over 70 musicians all of whom were living under conditions of social distancing. All sessions were recorded using Zoom software . After 3 months of twice weekly two hours improvisation sessions, 29 one-hour interviews with participants were undertaken, recorded, transcribed, and analysed. Key themes include how the sessions helped participants stay connected, provided opportunities for artistic development, enhanced mood, reduced feelings of isolation, had a positive effect on mood and sustained and developed community. Particular attention is placed upon how improvisation as a universal, real time, social, collaborative process facilitates interaction allowing the technological affordances of software (latencies, sound quality, gallery/speaker view) and hardware (laptop, tablet, instruments, microphones, headphones, objects in room) to become emergent properties of artistic collaborations. The extent to which this process affects new perceptual and conceptual breakthroughs for practitioners is discussed as is the crucial and innovative relationship between audio and visual elements. Analysis of edited films of the sessions highlight artistic and theoretical and conceptual issues discussed. Emphasis is given to how the domestic environment merges with technologies to create The Theatre of Home.},

This article focuses on such reconciliation-aimed intergroup encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians that seek to reduce hostility and increase understanding and cooperation between the two nationalities. Like other contact interventions conducted in settings of intergroup conflict, encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians represent a paradoxical project: this is a project that aspires to generate equality and cooperation between groups that are embedded in a protracted asymmetrical conflict. Though existing research teaches us valuable lessons on the effectiveness of contact conducted under optimal conditions, little is said about contact between groups involved in asymmetrical protracted dispute. The goal of this analysis is to examine the evolution of reconciliation-aimed contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Palestinians in the past 20 years. The research method is qualitative, relying on ethnographic data assembled during the relevant period of time. The findings identify and trace the evolution of four major models of Jewish\textendash Palestinian planned encounters: the Coexistence Model, the Joint Projects Model, the Confrontational Model, and the Narrative-Story-Telling Model. The strengths and limitations of each model in transforming intergroup attitudes in asymmetric conflict are discussed.},

This approach assesses the extent to which contact interventions, aimed at improving relations between sides in dispute, actually promote among their participants relationships, behaviors, and interactions that fulfill standards of social justice, equality, and fairness. Creating equality in communication models and reinforces values of mutual respect and tolerance. Thus, establishing symmetrical communication can be especially important for many interventions conducted to resolve conflicts marked by unequal distribution of power. One such asymmetrical conflict is the one between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in Israel. This article describes a study that applies our process-evaluation approach to assess equality and social justice in planned contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Arabs by measuring the degree to which members of the two groups contributed equally to the communication between them. Finally, the article presents guidelines, derived from this and other similar studies, for establishing communication equality in other planned contact interventions.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, planned intergroup contact interventions play an important role in attempts at conflict management and peace building. The present research raises a fundamental question regarding these interventions of ``is there contact at all?'' Based on previous research and observations, we claim that the occurrence of intergroup interactions in planned contact interventions between groups in conflict can subject to marked variability. Thus, this study's goal is to construct and apply a measure assessing the extent of intergroup interaction in such interventions. The data was collected through observations of planned encounters between Jews and Arabs that were conducted in Israel in 1999\textendash 2000. The findings show variability in the extent of intergroup interaction in the investigated programs. While the majority of these encounters (Some 65\% of them) were characterized by a high extent of intergroup interaction, some 20\% of them contained a medium level of interaction and some 15\% a low level one. The findings further indicate that programs targeted at high school students and adults were characterized by higher levels of intergroup interaction while programs targeted at preschool to fourth grade children and especially programs targeted at fifth to ninth graders included a lower extent of such interaction. Theoretical and practical implication of these findings are discussed. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In particular, we focus on practices that underpin the creation and articulation of online identities. Using qualitative data from extensive fieldwork involving 50 social media users we illustrate a variety of practices where users' enactment of social media shows the emergence of the agentic role of this materiality which enables and constrains identity creation. To this end, we show how performing identity on a particular social media has consequences in terms of further attempts to elaborate personal identity within the same social medium, across social media and ``offline''. We contribute to the sociomateriality literature which examines social media use seen as an enactment between human and material agency.},

By combining one of humankind's oldest technologies, textile processing, with electroactive polymers, we demonstrate here the feasibility of wearable, soft artificial muscles made by weaving and knitting, with tunable force and strain. These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices. Textile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain. Textile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain.},

It is now well established that intergroup contact can improve attitudes not only toward the out-group as a whole but also toward other, noncontacted groups (secondary transfer effect). We review evidence of a further, higher-order generalization effect whereby intergroup contact also impacts more general cognitive processes outside of the intergroup context (i.e., tertiary transfer effects). We present a taxonomy of transfer effects that explains these generalization effects as distinct outcomes of the contact process yet contingent on the same component process, specifically, the assessment of the semantic distance between the target (e.g., contacted individual) and the frame (e.g., group prototype). This conceptualization provides an explanatory framework for uniting the disparate forms of transfer effect in the contact literature, clarifying why primary and secondary transfer effects are facilitated by low semantic distance and why contact is more cognitively demanding under conditions of high semantic distance, but with greater potential for cognitive growth.},

In this paper, we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zerocentered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn highresolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.},

In particular, users most enhance on physical attributes that they perceive to be weak in real life. We also find that avatar attractiveness affects online behavioral traits such as extroversion and loudness. Lastly, we find support for a hierarchy of physical variation across online roles whereby people retain core identity elements (such as gender and race) across all their avatars, but they change peripheral elements (such as hair and clothing, and even face). We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for business and society.},

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori. (See ``Turning Point'' in this issue for an interview with Mori.).},

I find persistent changes to behaviors: Christians assigned to mixed teams are 12 percentage points more likely to attend a social event open to Muslims, 54 percentage points more likely to train with Muslims six months after the intervention ends, and 25 percentage points more likely to vote for a Muslim player to receive a sportsmanship award. These results seem to be driven by changing norms around social contact as well as a positive experience, with top-performing teams being more likely to patronize a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul. The impact on personal beliefs, however, was mixed. These findings point to the potential for positive and cooperative contact across social lines to build tolerant behaviors after conflict \textemdash{} even if underlying prejudice remains unchanged.},

  abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have proposed numerous methods to reduce prejudice and create more positive attitudes toward members of other groups. However, empirical support for the effectiveness of these methods is mixed at best. Here, we propose that intergroup attitudes tend to be highly resistant to change, and thus, any method aiming to change these attitudes will be effective only if it successfully overcomes this resistance. First, we argue that traditional methods used to promote positive intergroup attitudes are inadequate in this regard. Next, we suggest that narratives are a unique way of overcoming resistance because they create less reactance, transport individuals into a story world, and provide them with social models. We then describe empirical evidence suggesting that narratives are likely to be particularly useful for creating more positive attitudes toward members of other social groups. Finally, we propose a number of empirical and theoretical questions that present challenges for research on narratives and intergroup attitudes.},

Seventy-six students took part in a collaborative online course during one academic year connecting Jews and Arabs in Israel. They marked their perceived distance to their team members at the beginning and end of the course using the novel Team Circles tool. Initially both Arab and Jewish students felt closer to their in-group team members. However, perceived distances decreased significantly over time with Arab students reporting equal perceived distances to their in-group and out-group members after the course. The results from the Team Circles test were combined with repeated measures of intergroup attitudes using Implicit Association Tests. Although no significant changes in intergroup attitudes were observed, greater reduction in perceived distances to out-group team members resulted in lower levels of prejudice toward the out-group as a whole after the course.},

Traditionally, such systems are asymmetric in nature where only one side (participant) is ``teleported'' to the remote location. In this manuscript, the authors explore the possibility of symmetric three-dimensional telepresence where both sides (participants) are ``teleported'' simultaneously to each other's location; the overarching concept of symmetric telepresence in virtual environments is extended to telepresence robots in physical environments. Two identical physical humanoid robots located in UK and the USA serve as surrogates while performing a transcontinental shared collaborative task. The actions of these surrogate robots are driven by capturing the intent of the participants controlling them in either location. Participants could communicate verbally but could not see the other person or the remote location while performing the task. The effectiveness of gesturing along with other observations during this preliminary experiment is presented. Results reveal that the symmetric robotic telepresence allowed participants to use and understand gestures in cases where they would otherwise have to describe their actions verbally.

  abstract = {This paper presents a framework to interactively control avatars in remote environments. The system, called AMITIES, serves as the central component that connects people controlling avatars (inhabiters), various manifestations of these avatars (surrogates), and people interacting with these avatars (participants). A multiserver\textendash client architecture, based on a low-demand network protocol, connects the participant environment(s), the inhabiter station(s), and the avatars. A human-in-the-loop metaphor provides an interface for remote operation, with support for multiple inhabiters, multiple avatars, and multiple participants. Custom animation blending routines and a gesture-based interface provide inhabiters with an intuitive avatar control paradigm. This gesture control is enhanced by genres of program-controlled behaviors that can be triggered by events or inhabiter choices for individual or groups of avatars. This mixed (agency and gesture-based) control paradigm reduces the cognitive and physical loads on the inhabiter while supporting natural bidirectional conversation between participants and the virtual characters or avatar counterparts, including ones with physical manifestations, for example, robotic surrogates. The associated system affords the delivery of personalized experiences that adapt to the actions and interactions of individual users, while staying true to each virtual character's personality and backstory. In addition to its avatar control paradigm, AMITIES provides processes for character and scenario development, testing, and refinement. It also has integrated capabilities for session recording and event tagging, along with automated tools for reflection and after-action review. We demonstrate effectiveness by describing an instantiation of AMITIES, called TeachLivE, that is widely used by colleges of education to prepare new teachers and provide continuing professional development to existing teachers. Finally, we show the system's flexibility by describing a number of other diverse applications, and presenting plans to enhance capabilities and application areas.},

  abstract = {The notion of immersive witness underpins much of the exploration of virtual reality (VR) by journalists and humanitarian organisations. Immersive witness links the experience of VR with a moral attitude of responsibility for distant others. In accounts of media witness, the ability of the media to sustain an experience of presence has played an important, albeit often implicit, role linking the spectator spatially and temporally to distant suffering. However, the concept of media witness has to date assumed that the media represent, that news stories and documentaries present to their audiences images and sounds that communicate something of an event. VR, in contrast, seeks to simulate, providing the audience with something of an experience that is linked in various ways to the experiences of others. It is this simulative function that is seen as fundamental to VR's moral address. This paper explores the moral potential of VR suggesting that while there is much to recommend VR as a platform for humanitarian communication there is an inherent moral risk attached: the risk of improper distance. The United Nation's VR work serves as a case study for exploring VR's moral potential and the risk of improper distance.},

The actuator is made with different sizes to be used in a large range of applications such as robotic hands, robotic arms, and wearable soft exosuits. Five actuators were attached to a commercial glove fingers and form a wearable glove, the glove shows different gestures and it is able to hold 9 kg weights. With a larger scale, the bending actuator was able to hold 20 kg. In addition, a preliminary experiment shows a reduction of 50\% in EMG signals reflecting muscle activities during 9 kg weight bar grasping and releasing stages.},

Four strings are attached to the tip of the actuator and travelling through its longitudinal axis to the fixed side where they are pulled with different tension forces. The applied forces on all strings define the actuator behaviour when inflated. Bending in different directions, twisting, and elongation behaviours were generated online by varying the strings pulling forces and the air pressure of the actuator.},

In this article, we report on the telepresence offerings along with the user behaviors, experiences, and the social norms found for remote conference attendance. Our results across the studies focus around three main themes: shared vs. dedicated robot usage, identity presentation and the value and challenges associated with it; and local in-person support through proxies and instant messaging backchannels. These themes point to three different areas of design exploration for telepresence robots, pointing out the limitations of existing design solutions with respect to each theme, areas for future telepresence design work, and the value in considering varied telepresence robot solutions, including both dedicated and shared telepresence robots.},

We argue that careful design based on an understanding of non-verbal communication can mitigate these differences.

We alter the video image by framing the display such that, in one condition, only the head is visible while, in the other condition, the entire upper body is visible. We include a F2F control case. We used two measures of dyad empathy and found a significant difference between head-only framing and both upper-body framing and F2F, but no significant difference between upper-body framing and F2F. Based on these and earlier results, we present some design heuristics for video conferencing systems. We revisit earlier negative experimental results on video systems in the light of these new experiments. We conclude that for systems that preserve both gaze and upper-body cues, there is no evidence of deficit in communication effectiveness compared to face-to-face meetings.},

The vocabulary is based on number of sensitizing concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to bear. The strategy is based on the metaphorical movement of `zooming in' and `zooming out of' practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and re-positioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are foregrounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the article discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practice. The article concludes with some considerations on how the proposed approach can assist us in advancing the research agenda of organizational and work studies.},

However, even though increasing anthropomorphism is often seen as a promising way to achieve this goal, the uncanny valley effect proposes that anthropomorphism can be detrimental to acceptance unless robots are almost indistinguishable from humans. Against this background, we use a dual processing theory approach to investigate whether an uncanny valley of perceived trustworthiness (PT) can be observed for social robots and how this effect differs between the intuitive and deliberate reasoning system. The results of an experiment with four conditions and 227 participants provide support for the uncanny valley effect. Furthermore, mediation analyses suggested that use intention decreases through both reduced intuitive and deliberate PT for medium levels of anthropomorphism. However, for high levels of anthropomorphism (indistinguishable from real human), only intuitive PT determined use intention. Consequently, our results indicate both advantages and pitfalls of anthropomorphic design.},

We argue along 3 steps for a critical return to puppetry as a reference to design and analysis game character controls.

Three initial controller mappings for virtual rod puppets, marionettes, and hand puppets serve to highlight opportunities and challenges in this approach. The overall goal is to re-establish a puppet-based perspective to character controls for VR and to highlight the emerging design space for games.},

By controlling the movement of the internal weight together with other robotic behaviors such as hand gestures or speech dialogues, it is expected that emotional and/or intentional messaging between users is enhanced. To gain knowledge for designing effective weight shifts, an elicitation study was conducted to investigate how users holding this gadget in their hand interpreted its 36 weight shift patterns generated by setting four basic movement parameters (target position, trajectory, speed, and repetition). Results present mappings between these parameters and the emotional perception of the users. Furthermore, specifc weight shift patterns that can express certain human emotions and intentions are revealed. These fndings will be useful for designing effective weight shifts to enhance emotional and intentional messaging between users. This study attempts to open a new dimension for the expression capability of robotic gadgets.},

Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computercontrolled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases telepresence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

In this review, recent technological and statistical innovations with the potential to advance this body of research are presented. First, concerns over the validity of longitudinal models are discussed before innovative analytical techniques are introduced that explore change over time. Next, intensive repeated measure designs, such as experience sampling approaches, are introduced as opportunities to investigate the day-to-day lives of individuals. Virtual reality technology is then presented as another means to examine naturalistic contact experiences in the laboratory, offering researchers an unrivaled capacity to induce uncommon contact experiences. Finally, we propose that additional sources of contextual data, such as competing media messages, could extend these models in innovative ways by accounting for the time and place surrounding intergroup contact. Similarly, longitudinal social network analysis can provide additional contextual information by considering the broader network environment in which contact occurs. We describe these innovations with the intention of spurring future research that will advance our understanding of how intergroup contact can be used to improve our societies. Thus, we conclude with a discussion on how to bridge divides between researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract = {Textile based pneumatic actuators have recently seen increased development for use in wearable applications thanks to their high strength to weight ratio and range of achievable actuation modalities. However, the design of these textile-based actuators is typically an iterative process due to the complexity of predicting the soft and compliant behavior of the textiles. In this work we investigate the actuation mechanics of a range of physical prototypes of unfolding textile-based actuators to understand and develop an intuition for how the geometric parameters of the actuator affect the moment it generates, enabling more deterministic designs in the future. Under benchtop conditions the actuators were characterized at a range of actuator angles and pressures (0 \textendash 136 kPa), and three distinct performance regimes were observed, which we define as Shearing, Creasing, and Flattening. During Flattening, the effects of both the length and radius of the actuator dominate with maximum moments in excess of 80 Nm being generated, while during Creasing the radius dominates with generated moments scaling with the cube of the radius. Low stiffness spring like behavior is observed in the Shearing regime, which occurs as the actuator approaches its unfolded angle. A piecewise analytical model was also developed and compared to the experimental results within each regime. Finally, a prototype actuator was also integrated into a shoulder assisting wearable robot, and on-body characterization of this robot was performed on five healthy individuals to observe the behavior of the actuators in a wearable application. Results from this characterization highlight that these actuators can generate useful on-body moments (10.74 Nm at 90\textdegree{} actuator angle) but that there are significant reductions compared to bench-top performance, in particular when mostly folded and at higher pressures.},

Furthermore, we propose an automatic unpleasant stimuli avoidance system using online machine learning architecture constructed from echo state networks (ESNs) and Accumulator Based Arbitration Models (ABAMs) that can also flexibly adapt to remote users. Because the handheld telepresence robot can avoid unpleasant stimuli before remote users experience these stimuli, it provides them with a more comfortable communication environment while notifying people around the robot that uncomfortable stimulation is being avoided.},

The outcomes of contact at work were analysed controlling for the influence of contact outside the workplace and through mass media, and taking into account the role of empathy, anxiety and group membership salience. Results indicate that the beneficial effects of contact at work were partially mediated by increased empathy and reduced anxiety, experienced both in the work environment and towards immigrants in general. Finally, high levels of group membership salience facilitated the influence of contact on intergroup emotions. These findings show that contact at work can be a powerful means to reduce prejudice, thanks to its capacity to evoke changes in affective responses. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Despite their lightweight and simple structure, they have long inflation and deflation times, which make their quick use difficult. To resolve this issue, we propose an inflatable wrinkle actuator with fast inflation and deflation responses. First, a theoretical model is proposed to develop an actuator that satisfies the design requirements: the desired assistive torque and the foam factor based on the wearability. Second, we reduce the inflation and deflation times by partially controlling the actuator layers and by designing pneumatic circuits using a vacuum ejector. To validate the usability of the actuator in wearable suits, we applied it to a wearable knee suit, and the inflation and deflation times were 0.40 s and 0.16 s, respectively. As a result, we ensured that the actuator did not interfere with human knee joint movement during walking by creating any residual resistance.},

Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE .},

Evaluation of emotion expressions recognition becomes, thus, an important step in the development of project involving interaction between humans and avatars.

  abstract = {This thesis is a postphenomenological interrogation into the use of soft robots as mediating bodies between humans, attempting to unfetishize their imaginative figure of the stranger through an event I call incarnation. Based on my own encounters with Palestinians for conflict resolution and through readings of phenomenological and sociological studies, I determine the importance of the physical body, its fleshiness, nonlinearity and organic qualities for the constitution of intercorporeality - a meaningful and transformative dialog. I investigate the potential of non-human robotic avatars to achieve intercorpreality and liberate the interlocutors from prejudice and identity constraints, proposing the use of soft robots as a medium of re-embodiment that could facilitate massive scale physical incarnations and create physical encounters between people who are unable to otherwise meet in person. As a proof-of-concept, a novel method for the production of soft robotic avatars is introduced, capable of bodily haptics, language translation, and animalistic emotional expression. The avatar is operated using a web-based software platform that enables easy development of third party applications. Using this method, HITODAMA, a first prototype for a soft robotic avatar, is produced. I perform an initial evaluation of the robot in an encounter between people of different cultures, using an example app in which they get to know one another using pictures. I analyze the results by conducting interviews with the participants, following the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis.},

Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. The study discusses how avatar customization, identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup attitudes and intergroup relations.},

  abstract = {Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has inspired the design of engineering devices and structures for decades. The underlying principles of origami are very general, which has led to applications ranging from cardboard containers to deployable space structures. More recently, researchers have become interested in the use of active materials (i.e., those that convert various forms of energy into mechanical work) to effect the desired folding behavior. When used in a suitable geometry, active materials allow engineers to create self-folding structures. Such structures are capable of performing folding and/or unfolding operations without being kinematically manipulated by external forces or moments. This is advantageous for many applications including space systems, underwater robotics, small scale devices, and selfassembling systems. This article is a survey and analysis of prior work on active self-folding structures as well as methods and tools available for the design of folding structures in general and self-folding structures in particular. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic view of the state-of-the-art in this important and evolving area. Unifying structural principles for active self-folding structures are identified and used as a basis for a quantitative and qualitative comparison of numerous classes of active materials. Design considerations specific to folded structures are examined, including the issues of crease pattern identification and fold kinematics. Although few tools have been created with active materials in mind, many of them are useful in the overall design process for active self-folding structures. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of open questions for the field of origami-inspired engineering.},

The open statements analysed here about the contact situations and the ensuing evaluation of the Others were collected as part of an online questionnaire (N=1959). After a short theoretical introduction we reveal the intertwined nature of construing language use: first in each specific borderland, then in the triads speaking together either in the native language of one of the groups (Czechs with Austrians and Germans) or with each speaking their own native languages (Czechs with Poles and Slovaks). Finally we highlight several effects we have observed as a result of being able to compare the situation in more than one neighbourhood, for instance, the effect of the different statuses of the languages involved, or the connection between the language used in contact and a feeling of proximity.},

A meta-analysis of more than 500 studies established the theory's basic contention that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudices of many types. This paper addresses the issue of process: just how does contact diminish prejudice? We test meta-analytically the three most studied mediators: contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing empathy and perspective taking. Our tests reveal mediational effects for all three of these mediators. However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.

With 713 independent samples from 515 studies, the meta-analysis finds that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.},

We propose that there are a number of types of entrainment that build upon pre-existing adaptations that allow organisms to perceive stimuli as rhythmic, to produce periodic stimuli, and to integrate the two using sensory feedback. We suggest that social entrainment is a special case of spatiotemporal coordination where the rhythmic signal originates from another individual. We use this framework to understand the function and evolutionary basis for coordinated rhythmic movement and to explore questions about the nature of entrainment in music and dance. The framework of entrainment presented here has a number of implications for the vocal learning hypothesis and other proposals for the evolution of coordinated rhythmic behavior across an array of species.},

Structural violence, despite its pervasiveness and positive correlation with violent conflict, is often overlooked within key debates in peacebuilding. Arts, despite its prevalence at ground level, continue to remain outside the mainstream approaches to peacebuilding. In this article, I bring these two domains together and explore the potential of sustained engagement through theatre in building peace within violent structural narratives at community level. Based on an empirical study in West Bengal, India, I argue that theatre has the potential to bring prevalent but less-heard narratives of structural violence into communal discourse. I identify two key elements in this process: first, theatre offers a space where onstage resistance to structural violence is performed. Second, the performed resistance leads to triggering transformation within the violent structural narratives.},

For straight men with positive preattitudes, findings were in line with the hypothesis that positive intergroup emotions toward gay men were the relevant mediator.

  abstract = {Introduction. Fair Play is an avatar-based role-playing video game in which Jamal Davis, a Black graduate student at a research university, navigates implicit forms of racial bias to reach the win-state of earning his PhD and becoming a professor. Fair Play was designed to educate players on the existence of racial bias in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields in an experiential way and to encourage perspective-taking. Research has found that taking the perspective of another can induce empathy, which improves the empathizer's attitudes towards individuals and groups. Paired with a facilitated workshop, Fair Play was also designed to teach bias concepts to increase participants' bias literacy., Intervention. Research on workshops to reduce gender bias suggests that it increased awareness of personal bias, the motivation and self-efficacy to practice bias-reducing strategies, and a more welcoming department climate and the hiring of more women faculty three years after the intervention. Capitalizing on these findings, a 3-hour workshop was developed to reduce race-based bias against Black/African Americans in STEMM using Fair Play., Conclusions. The facilitation of the workshops and Fair Play requires particular competencies due to its topic (racial bias) and player's skepticism about the reality of the bias incidents. Our data suggest that participants who identify as a person of color are more likely to believe that bias exists compared to White players, which can lead to a discussion about how the incidents in the game were designed and scripted. The facilitator also needs to be versed in a number of intentional design choices, such as Jamal not having voiceover and his success. Finally, this paper describes the Facilitator Game, which was developed as a complement to the game and allows a facilitator to jump to bias incidents quickly while debriefing and discussing the game to further participant learning.},

Due to the affordances of parasociality and self-presence, a dialectic interaction develops between the user and the avatar as extended and extraordinary self. This dialectic enables the avatar-persona to express a certain degree of influence over the user in some circumstances. My discussion of these dynamics is illustrated from observations made during an extended participant observation in a multi-user virtual environment Second Life.},

Robotic telepresence systems - systems that combine video-conferencing capabilities with robotic navigation to allow geographically dispersed people to maneuver in remote locations - represent remote users, operators, to local users, locals, through the use of an alternate physical representation. In this representation, physical characteristics such as height are dictated by the manufacturer of the system. We conducted a two-by-two (relative system height: shorter vs. taller; team role: leader vs. follower), between-participants study (n = 40) to investigate how the system's height affects the local's perceptions of the operator and subsequent interactions. Our findings show that, when the system was shorter than the local and the operator was in a leadership role, the local found the operator to be less persuasive. Furthermore, having a leadership role significantly affected the local's feelings of dominance with regard to being in control of the conversation.},

  abstract = {Are students willing to accept robotic support for learning when their attitudes toward educational robots are moderate? Probably not, as evidence from psychological research has suggested that attitudes predict how people will behave toward an attitude object. Consequently, a negative view of robots could represent a strong barrier to the deployment of robots in educational environments. Attitude change might facilitate a smooth introduction of educational robots into learning settings. Thus, the present research builds on the fact that actively including end users in the prototyping process of a robot might increase positive attitudes toward it. Indeed, our research is among the first works which demonstratethat participation in the prototyping process of an educational robot positively affected attitudes toward educational robots in general and significantly reduced educational robot anxiety. However, students' behavioral intentions toward educational robots were not influenced by participation. These findings raise intriguing questions regarding the relevance of user involvement in the development of robots. Therefore, the discussion focuses on how to improve this process and how user involvement in robot design processes provides a valuable contribution to the acceptance of social robots in everyday life.},

The visual context of a conversation has two aspects: the information that is available to each conversant, and their beliefs about what is present for each other. In our experiment, we separated these factors for the first time and examined their impact on a spontaneous conversation. We manipulated the fact that a visual scene was shared or not and the belief that a visual scene was shared or not. Participants watched videos of actors talking about a controversial topic, then discussed their own views while looking at either a blank screen or the actors. Each believed (correctly or not) that their partner was either looking at a blank screen or the same images. We recorded conversants' eye movements, quantified how they were coordinated, and analyzed their speech patterns. Gaze coordination has been shown to be causally related to the knowledge people share before a conversation, and the information they later recall. Here, we found that both the presence of the visual scene, and beliefs about its presence for another, influenced language use and gaze coordination.},

However, many promising applications are limited by the dependence of soft systems on electrical or pneumatic tethers. Recent work in soft actuation and electronics has made removing such cords more feasible, heralding a variety of applications from autonomous field robotics to wireless biomedical devices. Here we review the development of functional untethered soft robotics. We focus on recent advances in soft robotic actuation, sensing and integration as they relate to untethered systems, and consider the key challenges the field faces in engineering systems that could have practical use in real-world conditions.},

In particular, we wanted to understand how Arabic people might view having humanoid robots in their daily lives, and developed a questionnaire to understand these views. We also built an end-to-end Arabic conversational system on our humanoid robot Ibn Sina, and brought the robot to a mall in the United Arab Emirates. At the mall we encouraged people to interact with the robot as well as complete our questionnaire. With 131 respondents from 21 countries, our findings show significant regional differences in overall attitudes (people from the Gulf viewed humanoid robots more favorably than people from Africa), as well as an effect from college education (people with college degrees viewed humanoid robots less favorably than people without college degrees).},

In exploring these three issues we utilise theoretical interpretations of subjectivity and embodiment alongside a brief examination of a speech by Prime Minister Howard in order to elaborate our claim that racism is foundational to white subjectivities in Australia. By examining colonial violence and our relation to it, we seek to develop a framework within which psychological research on racism in Australia may disturb white claims to belonging by continuing to explore how racism works in the service of the `good nation'.

Embodiment and interaction \textendash{} known as intercorporeality is unique to the notion of `place'; without it, we cannot lay claim to being in any place. This assertion has implications for the argument that there can be such a thing as an online `place'.

Postphenomenology presents a unique blend of insights from the philosophical traditions of phenomenology and American pragmatism, and applies them to studies of user relations to technologies. These studies provide deep descriptions of the ways technologies transform our abilities, augment our experience, and shape the world around us. This book proceeds with a preface by Don Ihde, postphenomenology's founder, and a detailed review of the main ideas of this perspective by the editors Robert Rosenberger and Peter-Paul Verbeek. The body of this volume is composed of twelve postphenomenological essays which reflect the expansive range, detail-orientation, and interdisciplinarity of this school of thought. These essays confront a broad assortment of topics, both abstract and concrete. Abstract topics addressed include metaphysics, ethics, methodology, and analysis of the notions of selfhood, skill training, speed, and political activism. Just a few of the concrete topics studied include human-like interactive robots, ethics education, image interpretation in radiology, science fiction tropes, transportation history, wearable computing, and organ donation protocols for brain-dead bodies. The volume concludes with constructive critiques of postphenomenology by Andrew Feenberg, Diane Michelfelder, and Albert Borgmann, all figures whose work is relevant to postphenomenological projects.},

This increase of interest in agent ontologies can be attributed to the new feminist materialist movement in the philosophy of science literature. However, agent ontologies also are found in Indigenous studies literature and in Peircean pragmatism. These latter sources are also a part of the current methodological conversation about nonhuman agency. This article explores the connections between agential realist philosophy and social science research that employs narrative forms of analysis and representation. The goal is to assist narrative researchers in avoiding oversimplification by tracing out different strands in these literatures and mapping out points of connection and disconnection in detail. Intersections that hold the promise of complementary development are highlighted.},

These animals have mastered the ability to repair and replace most of their tissues following damage or amputation even well into adulthood. In fact it seems that the ability of these organisms to regenerate perfectly is not affected by their age. In addition to being able to regenerate, these animals display a remarkable resistance to cancer. They therefore represent a unique model organism to study regeneration and cancer resistance in vertebrates. The need for this research is even more pressing at the dawn of the 21st century as we are faced with an ever aging world population which has to deal with an increase in organ failure and cancer incidence. Hopefully, this mini review will put in perspective some of the reasons why studying tissue regeneration in salamanders could yield significant knowledge to help regenerative medicine achieve the desired goal of allowing humans to repair and regenerate some of their own tissues as they age.},

We propose that beyond improving attitudes toward the out-group, positive contact affects disadvantaged-group members' perceptions of intergroup inequality in ways that can undermine their support for social change toward equality. In Study 1, participants were assigned to either high- or lowpower experimental groups and then brought together to discuss either commonalities between the groups or intergroup differences. Commonality-focused contact, relative to difference-focused contact, produced heightened expectations for fair (i.e., egalitarian) out-group behavior among members of disadvantaged groups. These expectations, however, proved unrealistic when compared against the actions of members of the advantaged groups. Participants in Study 2 were Israeli Arabs (a disadvantaged minority) who reported the amount of positive contact they experienced with Jews. More positive intergroup contact was associated with increased perceptions of Jews as fair, which in turn predicted decreased support for social change. Implications for social change are considered.},

  abstract = {An extensive meta-analysis of the contact literature, summarizing over five hundred studies across a wide range of contexts and countries, found that although intergroup contact was related to improved attitudes among members of both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, it was found to be significantly less effective for improving the outgroup attitudes of disadvantaged group members than those of advantaged group members. Furthermore, optimal conditions in the contact situation (e.g., cooperation, equal status, institutional support) were found to facilitate the effect of contact only for members of advantaged groups; the presence of these conditions did not have a significant impact on disadvantaged group members involved in intergroup contact. Researchers have begun to consider differences in how advantaged versus disadvantaged group members approach, experience, and are affected by intergroup contact. For instance, findings from a U.S. national survey show that while positive effects of contact are typically observed among White Americans, they are significantly inhibited among Black Americans who perceive high levels of discrimination against their racial group. Experimental and diary studies further indicate that exposure to prejudice and discrimination can undermine minorities' willingness to engage in contact with members of the advantaged majority group. Still, such findings offer little information regarding the ways in which group differences in power are enacted in contact settings, or how intergroup contact can either perpetuate or ameliorate group differences in power. In this chapter, we review emerging evidence that can advance our understanding of the intersection of power and contact between groups. We begin by considering how psychological processes associated with group position (i.e., advantaged versus disadvantaged group membership) relate to how people approach contact situations in terms of their goals and preferences for the content of intergroup encounters. We then describe research that links the consequences of intergroup contact to power asymmetries between groups and to processes that promote social change. We conclude by discussing the implications of this work for research and practice on improving intergroup relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Female participants (N = 133) customized an avatar in a digital game to reflect either the ideal, ought, or actual self. Participants then selected food items for their avatar within the digital game as well as food items for themselves to eat afterward. Results suggest that for participants using an ought-self avatar, the extent to which they were conscious of their health was positively related to healthier food choice both within and after playing the game. No such effect emerged for participants who used an ideal- or actual-self avatar, indicating that participants formed the goal of being healthy only with regard to the ought self. This study demonstrates that avatar customization in a digital game can serve a regulatory function by representing individuals' duties and responsibilities, thus, causing them to adopt such attributes manifested in their avatar during and after the game.},

  abstract = {Two types of social influence can be distinguished: norm-based influence occurs when social identity is salient and interpersonal influence occurs when personal identity is salient. In two experiments the impact of trait and state private self-awareness on interpersonal influence during face-to-face and computer-mediated communication (CMC) was investigated. It is argued that interpersonal influence resulting from face-to-face communication is stronger than interpersonal influence resulting from CMC because CMC heightens state private self-awareness. As a result, it leads to a focus on personal perceptions and thoughts which in turn reduces attitude change. Experiment 1 suggests that communication media may influence attitude change via private self-awareness. Experiment 2 showed that trait private self-awareness moderates the effect of communication media on interpersonal influence. Interpersonal influence was stronger in face-to-face communication than in CMC only for individuals higher in private self-awareness. This finding indicates that the impact of situational variations of a concept can be limited to individuals who have a more elevated sense of private selfawareness.

  abstract = {The growing interest in soft robots comes from the new possibilities offered by these systems to cope with problems that cannot be addressed by robots built from rigid bodies. Many innovative solutions have been developed in recent years to design soft components and systems. They all demonstrate how soft robotics development is closely dependent on advanced manufacturing processes. This review aims at giving an insight on the current state of the art in soft robotics manufacturing. It first puts in light the elementary components that can be used to develop soft actuators, whether they use fluids, shape memory alloys, electro-active polymers or stimuli-responsive materials. Other types of elementary components, such as soft smart structures or soft-rigid hybrid systems, are then presented. The second part of this review deals with the manufacturing methods used to build complete soft structures. It includes molding, with possibly reinforcements and inclusions, additive manufacturing, thin-film manufacturing, shape deposition manufacturing, and bonding. The paper conclusions sums up the pros and cons of the presented techniques, and open to developing topics such as design methods for soft robotics and sensing technologies.},

Guided by the biobehavioral synchrony conceptual frame, we tested bidirectional influences between the partners' hormones and conflict behavior at the initiation of romantic love. Participants included 120 new lovers (60 couples) and 40 singles. Plasma levels of five affiliation and stress-related hormones were assessed: oxytocin (OT), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T), cortisol (CT), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Couples were observed in conflict interaction coded for empathy and hostility. CT and DHEAS showed direct actor effects: higher CT and DHEAS predicted greater hostility. OT showed direct partner effects: individuals whose partners had higher OT showed greater empathy. T and CT showed combined actor-partner effects. High T predicted greater hostility only when partner also had high T, but lower hostility when partner had low T. Similarly, CT predicted low empathy only in the context of high partner's CT. Mediational analysis indicated that combined high CT in both partners was associated with relationship breakup as mediated by decrease in empathy. Findings demonstrate the mutual influences between hormones and behavior within an attachment bond and underscore the dynamic, co-regulated, and systemic nature of pair-bond formation in humans.},

  abstract = {Romantic relationships can have a profound effect on adults' health and well-being whereas the inability to maintain intimate bonds has been associated with physical and emotional distress. Studies in monogamous mammalian species underscore the central role of oxytocin (OT) in pair-bonding and human imaging studies implicate OT-rich brain areas in early romantic love. To assess the role of OT in romantic attachment, we examined plasma OT in 163 young adults: 120 new lovers (60 couples) three months after the initiation of their romantic relationship and 43 non-attached singles. Twenty-five of the 36 couples who stayed together were seen again six months later. Couples were observed in dyadic interactions and were each interviewed regarding relationship-related thoughts and behaviors. OT was significantly higher in new lovers compared to singles, F(1,152)=109.33, p{$<$}.001, which may suggest increased activity of the oxytocinergic system during the early stages of romantic attachment. These high levels of OT among new lovers did not decrease six months later and showed high individual stability. OT correlated with the couples' interactive reciprocity, including social focus, positive affect, affectionate touch, and synchronized dyadic states, and with anxieties and worries regarding the partner and the relationship, findings which parallel those described for parent-infant bonding. OT levels at the first assessment differentiated couples who stayed together six months later from those who separated during this period. Regression analysis showed that OT predicted interactive reciprocity independent of sex, relationship duration, and the partner's OT. Findings suggest that OT may play an important role at the first stages of romantic attachment and lend support to evolutionary models suggesting that parental and romantic attachment share underlying bio-behavioral mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Within an embodied cognition framework, it is argued that presence in a virtual environment (VE) develops from the construction of a spatial-functional mental model of the VE. Two cognitive processes lead to this model: the representation of bodily actions as possible actions in the VE, and the suppression of incompatible sensory input. It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was confirmed in two studies (N ϭ 246 and N ϭ 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of ``realness'' were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors. Building on these results, a thirteen-item presence scale consisting of three independent components was developed and verified using confirmatory factor analyses across the two studies.},

Even though disembodiment has been severely criticized in the literature, most conceptualizations of the role of users' bodies in virtuality nevertheless reflect a representational logic, which fails to capture contemporary users' experience of cyborgism. Relying on data collected from nine entrepreneurs in the virtual world Second Life (SL), this paper asks how embodied identity is performed in virtual worlds. Contrasting representationalism with performativity, this study highlights that the SL entrepreneurs intentionally re-presented in their avatars some of the attributes of physical bodies, but that they also engaged in habitual practices in-world, thereby unconsciously enacting embodied identities in both their `real' and virtual lives.},

We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence.},

We argue that the emergent properties of self-categorization and social identity, which are particularly fluid and complex in online spaces, provide a complementary perspective with which to re-examine traditional topics in social computing. We discuss the applicability of the Social Identity Perspective to established and new research domains in CSCW, proposing alternative perspectives on self-presentation, social support, collaboration, conflict, and leadership. We note methodological considerations emerging from this theory. Finally, we consider how broad concepts and lessons from the Social Identity Perspective might inspire CSCW work in the future.},

  abstract = {We have recently demonstrated that motor execution, observation, and imagery of movements expressing certain emotions can enhance corresponding affective states and therefore could be used for emotion regulation. But which specific movement(s) should one use in order to enhance each emotion? This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions.},

Included is the subclass of teleoperation called telerobotics, which means human supervisory control of remote semiautomatic systems, and the phenomenon of telepresence, in which special sensing and display technology enables the human to feel present at the remote location even though not really there. Current and new applications are reviewed. Techniques for human-computer cooperation in planning, commanding, and sensing are described. The telerobot is considered as a paradigm for any complex vehicle or process having many separate automatic control loops all of which are supervised by a human; some current examples are presented. Finally, opinions are given as to the current status of the field.},

The actuator is monolithic, fabricated via a molding process, and measures 90 mm in length, 20 mm in width, and 17 mm in thickness. Thanks to the composite mechanical characteristics similar to those of silicone elastomers, the actuator exhibits a bending angle of 170.3 \{\textbackslash deg\} and a blocked force of 0.34 N at the applied pressure of 25 kPa. These values are comparable to elastomer based pneumatic actuators. As a validation example, two actuators are integrated to form a gripper capable of handling various objects, highlighting the high performance and applicability of the edible actuator. These edible actuators, combined with other recent edible materials and electronics, could lay the foundation for a new type of edible robots.},

Nadler, 2002; A. Nadler \& I. Liviatan, 2004; A. Nadler \& N. Shnabel, in press). On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one's status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one's image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties' willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.},

The authors differentiate six therapeutic factors that emerged from a review of the literature: facilitating expression of emotions, catharsis, rich and deep expressions, verbal communication, revealing unconscious material, and concretization and symbolization. Short case examples of therapeutic processes are described to illustrate these ideas.},

This essay attempts to bring together the insights of recent scholarship in various disciplines in order to outline a general animation model, first presenting some of the characteristics of animation that allow it to draw connections between social, technological, and psychic structures, and then examining some of the ways that the models of animation and performance interact in contemporary subcultural practices.

To serve as a potential tool for quality improvement of EHRs. Methods Using observations, literature, information technology (IT) logs, vendor and US Food and Drug Administration reports, we constructed scenarios/models of how patients' realities, clinicians' mental models, and EHRs can misalign to produce distortions in comprehension and treatment. We then categorized them according to an emergent typology derived from the cases themselves and refined the categories based on insights gained from the literature of interactive sociotechnical systems analysis, decision support science, and human computer interaction. Typical of grounded theory methods, the categories underwent repeated modifications. Results We constructed 45 scenarios of misalignment between patients' physical realities, clinicians' mental models, and EHRs. We then identified five general types of misrepresentation in these cases: IT data too narrowly focused; IT data too broadly focused; EHRs miss critical reality; data multiplicities\textendash perhaps contradictory or confusing; distortions from data reflected back and forth across users, sensors, and others. The 45 scenarios are presented, organized by the five types. Conclusions With humans, there is a physical reality and actors' mental models of that reality. In healthcare, there is another player: the EHR/healthcare IT, which implicitly and explicitly reflects many mental models, facets of reality, and measures thereof that vary in reliability and consistency. EHRs are both microcosms and shapers of medical care. Our typology and scenarios are intended to be useful to healthcare IT designers and implementers in improving EHR systems and reducing the unintended negative consequences of their use.},

  abstract = {This article introduces narrative analysis as a way of engaging with storied data. Some key assumptions are first unpacked, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings of narrative research. The approach to narrative described in this article derives from narrative constructionism. This assumes that stories do more than simply reflect or recount experience: they act in people's lives in ways that matter deeply. The paper then distinguishes between two broad standpoints for approaching analysis, those of `story analyst' and `storyteller', before going on to describe how to conduct a particular form of constructionist narrative analysis \textendash dialogical narrative analysis. The paper goes on by introducing an emerging trend of thought that attempts to reach beyond the shortcomings of narrative constructionism. That is new materialism. Shifting the analytical focus from stories and narratives to assemblages, new materialism is interested in how narrative and materiality affect each other within networks of human and non-human actors. After discussing what this might mean for researchers, pluralism is presented as an opportunity to combine different analytical worlds in a single study. Finally, an uncommon articulation of pluralism termed diffractive reading is highlighted and exemplified though a study combining narrative dialogism and new materialism. The paper closes with thoughts on the future of narrative in companionship with alternative approaches.},

This theoretical framework allows me to question the potentialities of gaming, movies and dreams as they enter intra-activities with the comprehensive set of apparatuses that enact a child's agency, subjectivity and relational practices. The analyses and conceptual refinements that I present here are based on empirical data involving interviews with and observations of children between 8 and 14 years of age.},

First, VR poses potential mental health risks, including Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. Second, VR technology raises serious concerns related to personal neglect of users' own actual bodies and real physical environments. Third, VR technologies may be used to record personal data which could be deployed in ways that threaten personal privacy and present a danger related to manipulation of users' beliefs, emotions, and behaviors. Finally, there are other moral and social risks associated with the way VR blurs the distinction between the real and illusory. These concerns regarding VR naturally raise questions about public policy. The article makes several recommendations for legal regulations of VR that together address each of the above concerns. It is argued that these regulations would not seriously threaten personal liberty but rather would protect and enhance the autonomy of VR consumers.},

Here we examined this phenomenon further towards understanding whether other socially marginalized cues (racialization in the likeness of Asian and Black identities), like female-gendering, are associated with the manifestation of dehumanization (e.g., objectification, stereotyping) in human-robot interactions. To that end, we analyzed free-form comments (N = 535) on three videos, each depicting a gynoid - Bina48, Nadine, or Yangyang - racialized as Black, White, and Asian respectively. As a preliminary control, we additionally analyzed commentary (N = 674) on three videos depicting women embodying similar identity cues. The analyses indicate that people more frequently dehumanize robots racialized as Asian and Black, than they do of robots racialized as White. Additional, preliminary evaluation of how people's responding towards the gynoids compares to that towards other people suggests that the gynoids' ontology (as robots) further facilitates the dehumanization.},

  abstract = {Interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking at the same pace or dancing to the same beat, can strengthen pro-social behavior and affiliation. People all over the world come together every now and then to become entrained with a shared musical rhythm. Thus, the social and emotional power of music might further tighten interpersonal bonds. In the current study, we investigated whether social entrainment affects affiliation and helpfulness more strongly when tapping to music compared with a metronome. The between-subjects design consisted of four groups: tapping to the beat of music or to an isochronous metronome with an experimenter who tapped synchronously or asynchronously. The results of an implicit test showed that when listening to music, participants were more helpful toward a person who tapped synchronously compared with asynchronously. No such effect was found when listening and tapping to a metronome. The results of explicit ratings of the experimenter's likability, however, did not confirm this effect. Music is a product of social interactions and might even be the result of evolutionary adaptation. Thus, we conclude that interpersonal synchrony or asynchrony during listening to music can fulfill or violate hard-wired social expectations. Compared with the experience of just moving in synchrony with a simple isochronous timekeeper, such as a metronome, social entrainment with music might increase social bonding by adding an extra layer of affective and neurophysiological mechanisms. The current experiment additionally shows that implicit or indirect measures can help elucidate how music, entrainment, affiliation, and pro-social behavior are connected.

Twenty-four individuals rowed on ergometers for 45 min in both individual and group conditions. Half the participants rowed in the group condition with teammates, whereas the other half rowed them with confederates. ANOVA procedures revealed pain tolerance was significantly higher after participating in a group condition than in an individual condition, and that there was no significant difference between a group of strangers and teammates. This higher pain tolerance has been inferred as an indicator of endorphin activity, which may be related to behavioral synchrony.},

The construction is of fiber-reinforced rubber, and the mechanism is very simple. Gentle miniature robots with no conventional links can be designed using this design. The FMA's basic characteristics and its applications to certain robot mechanisms are presented. Serially connected FMAs act as a miniature robot manipulator. The kinematics and control algorithm for this type of robot are presented. FMAs combined in parallel act as a multifingered robot hand, with each FMA representing a finger. An algorithm for the cooperative control of such FMAs, the stable region for holding, and its performance are presented.{$<>$}},

Correlations between the subscales and other evaluations of the robot's behaviour found meaningful results, supporting the use of the NARS in English speaking samples.},

Video conferencing is already common in educational settings, where a foreign language is taught by a native teacher from a remote location; however, there is a serious issue in that children tend to have difficulties or freeze when facing teachers who speak a different language over a monitor. We hypothesize that a child-operated telepresence robot that offers physical participation and operability will help to address this issue. To investigate this hypothesis, we conduct a field experiment with 52 participants (4\textendash 8 years old) in classroom environments, and the use of a telepresence robot system is compared with a baseline Skype condition. The results show the advantages of the telepresence robot system for both children and teachers.},

Individuals bring their biases and prejudices with them as they enter virtual spaces. Drawing from theories of real-world interracial interaction, predictable affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes undermine the quality of live interracial interactions. Emerging research using VR suggests that these same challenges occur in virtual social interactions. These challenges can be addressed using evidence-based best practices and policy recommendations: Improving racial/ethnic representation in VR, regulating codes of conduct, ensuring transparency about privacy/consent, and reducing explicit and implicit racist behavior. Following these recommendations can improve VR interracial contact and, in turn, realworld interracial interactions. While VR can serve as a unique tool to bring people together, carefully considered policies must mitigate the negative effects of racial bias that can hinder the progress of improved interracial interactions.},

This proposition was previously examined with Israeli Jewish participants and here is re-examined in three samples, aged 8\textemdash 17, including Israeli Arabs and two groups from the Palestinian Authority. The three samples were based in different intergroup contexts in which their group status was relatively high, medium or low. The findings demonstrate differences in the relationship between contextually defined collective self-esteem and intergroup attitudes. Results confirmed the hypothesis that in conflict, irrespective of age highest intergroup biases would be displayed by the high status group. However, the hypothesis that the lowest status group would express only more negativity toward the out-group was not confirmed. The developmental hypothesis that pre- and early adolescents from the high status group would express most varied and extreme biases was also confirmed. With some exceptions in the middle status group, all older adolescents displayed moderation in biases.},

A marker based system is used to capture human motion data. From this data we extract the shoulder and elbow joint angles, which uniquely characterize a particular hand gesture. The proposed imitation learning framework aims to generalize over multiple demonstrations of the same hand gesture and thus learn it. The set of joint angle trajectories used for training are first aligned temporally using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and then generalized by weighted averaging. The framework operates in the joint space. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on the Nao Humanoid robot. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the proposed imitation learning framework. We place markers on the robot's arm analogous to the placement of markers on the human subject's arm, and then compare the respective joint angle trajectories.},

  abstract = {The minimum frustration principle (MFP) is a computational approach stating that, over the long time scales of evolution, proteins' free energy decreases more than expected by thermodynamical constraints as their amino acids assume conformations progressively closer to the lowest energetic state. This Review shows that this general principle, borrowed from protein folding dynamics, can also be fruitfully applied to nervous function. Highlighting the foremost role of energetic requirements, macromolecular dynamics, and above all intertwined time scales in brain activity, the MFP elucidates a wide range of mental processes from sensations to memory retrieval. Brain functions are compared with trajectories that, over long nervous time scales, are attracted toward the low-energy bottom of funnel-like structures characterized by both robustness and plasticity. We discuss how the principle, derived explicitly from evolution and selection of a funneling structure from microdynamics of contacts, is unlike other brain models equipped with energy landscapes, such as the Bayesian and free energy principles and the Hopfield networks. In summary, we make available a novel approach to brain function cast in a biologically informed fashion, with the potential to be operationalized and assessed empirically. \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Towards this end, we verified the validity of the scale with telepresence robots using an online video survey. We found differences across different cultures and gender much like other researcher in the past.

Our analysis is based on two complementary sets of qualitative data gleaned from in situ experiences of Finnish youth and young adults within the sharing mechanisms of Facebook and Last.fm. In our analysis, we identified social norms that were formed around the prevailing sharing practices in the two sites and compared them in relation to the sharing mechanisms. The analysis revealed that automated and manual sharing were sanctioned differently. We conclude that although the social norms that guide content sharing differed between the two contexts, there was an identical sociocultural goal in profile work: presentation of authenticity.},

  abstract = {Often, virtual environments and video games have established goals, and to achieve them, users must either compete or cooperate with others. The common ingroup identity model predicts that individuals maintain multiple identities at any given time based on roles, demographics, and contextual factors, and that they interpret others based on similarity (i.e., perceived ingroup) or dissimilarity (i.e., perceived outgroup) to these identities. In this experiment, we manipulated two aspects of a virtual partner's identity\textemdash race and task collaboration\textemdash to determine how users would perceive others in a virtual world. White participants (N = 99) played an anagram game competitively (outgroup) or cooperatively (ingroup) in a virtual environment with a black (outgroup) or white (ingroup) virtual partner. Contrary to hypotheses, performing either task led to more positive evaluations of black avatars than white avatars.},

  abstract = {We conducted a 2 \texttimes{} 2 between-subjects experiment to examine the effects of two orientation and two gaze behaviors during group conversations for a mobile, low degree-of-freedom robot. For this experiment, we designed a novel protocol to induce changes in the robot's group and study different social contexts. In addition, we implemented a perception system to track participants and control the robot's orientation and gaze with little human intervention. The results showed that the gaze behaviors under consideration affected the participants' perception of the robot's motion and that its motion affected human perception of its gaze. This mutual dependency implies that robot gaze and body motion must be designed and controlled jointly, rather than independently of each other. Moreover, the orientation behaviors that we studied led to similar feelings of inclusion and sense of belonging to the robot's group, suggesting that both can be primitives for more complex orientation behaviors.},

Sometimes referred to as ``hyperlocal'' journalists, these practitioners have launched news outlets in local communities (Harte, Howell, \&amp; Williams, 2018). They provide an invaluable service, particularly in the light of widespread closures of local newspapers. I had planned an ambitious project focused on traveling around the UK to interview community journalists about their work.

  abstract = {Background This article will look at the viability of the inclusion of mindfulness into the nursing curriculum. In nursing, the environment rarely allows the time for contemplation, though reflection is encouraged specifically in regard to the care we confer on our patients and how that impacts on us professionally. Student nurses are taught to hide their feelings to a point where they cannot find it themselves under their professional armour. Mindfulness is a possible way of bridging this gap. Discussion Our nursing code is geared to safeguard the patient from any harm as well as our colleagues but little is done or said in support of our own personal psychological or emotional health. The helping professions are restricted by legislation which has had an impact of fostering caution and fearfulness. In using mindfulness it can be seen as a possibility in building a bridge between what actually happens in a nurse's professional life and the possibility of reengaging with that internal emotional space. If student nurses begin to incorporate mindfulness techniques, in reality this should make a difference. This was experienced with students doing these exercises, who reported anecdotally feeling more centred. As they have progressed in the course feedback from the students using the techniques has been positive not only for the students but also for them using the skills in a clinical setting, benefiting patients. Conclusion Mindfulness has been used as a part of the modality of health care. It is clear that mindfulness is another way of dealing with the stressors of the modern heath service in which the students are being introduced. Incorporating this coping strategy into the curriculum ensures that students will have the tools to deal with the stressors of the course, which in turn will enhance the student experience.},

This study set out to assess the impact of two brief indirect contact interventions on lay people's inclusion attitudes, social distance and positive behavioral intentions, and to explore emotional reactions towards the two interventions. 925 participants completed the first online survey. Participants were randomized to watch either a 10 min film based on intergroup contact theory, or a film based on a protest message. In total, 403 participants completed the follow-up survey at one month. Both interventions were effective at changing inclusion attitudes and social distance in the short term and these effects were partially maintained at one month. The protest based intervention had a greater effect compared to the contact one on aspects of inclusion attitudes and evoked stronger emotional reactions. Despite small effect sizes, brief indirect contact interventions may have a potential role in tackling public stigma associated with intellectual disability but their effects on behavioral intentions are questionable.},

Flexible pneumatic actuators have been broadly explored in soft robotic engineering field where large strokes are required to interface with human body in delicate environments. Some of them have successfully demonstrated the capability of contracting, extending, bending, and/or twisting. This paper presents a precise and effective way of designing a pneumatic bending actuator by using finite element analysis (FEA) modelling and pure winding technique. The proposed pneumatic bending actuator (PBA) is capable of generating satisfactory force and bending displacement upon internal air pressurization, and also maintains low profile, light weight, compliant nature and robustness against pressurization. The prototype actuators with a length of 220 mm, internal diameter of 9 mm and a thickness of 2 mm have been verified to achieve an angular displacement of 171\textdegree{} at its free end and produce bending force 7.1 N at an operating pressure of 0.675 MPa. Simulation and experimental results were compared and demonstrated good consistency.},

However, in addition to these positive aspects, digital technology also provides an effective medium for spreading hateful content in the form of cyberbullying, bigotry, hateful ideologies, and harassment of individuals and groups. This research aims to investigate the growing body of online hate research (OHR) by mapping general research indices, prevalent themes of research, research hotspots, and influential stakeholders such as organizations and contributing regions. For this, we use scientometric techniques and collect research papers from the Web of Science core database published through March 2019. We apply a predefined search strategy to retrieve peer-reviewed OHR and analyze the data using CiteSpace software by identifying influential papers, themes of research, and collaborating institutions. Our results show that higher-income countries contribute most to OHR, with Western countries accounting for most of the publications, funded by North American and European funding agencies. We also observed increased research activity post-2005, starting from more than 50 publications to more than 550 in 2018. This applies to a number of publications as well as citations. The hotbeds of OHR focus on cyberbullying, social media platforms, co-morbid mental disorders, and profiling of aggressors and victims. Moreover, we identified four main clusters of OHR: (1) Cyberbullying, (2) Sexual solicitation and intimate partner violence, (3) Deep learning and automation, and (4) Extremist and online hate groups, which highlight the cross-disciplinary and multifaceted nature of OHR as a field of research. The research has implications for researchers and policymakers engaged in OHR and its associated problems for individuals and society.},

In the information systems discipline, her theory underpins much of the work that goes under the rubric of sociomateriality. Importantly, her work challenges the validity of theories about the world based on representationalism and so-called Cartesian dualism. At least some scholars who subscribe to sociomateriality argue that one consequence of Barad's theory is that information systems theories such as representation theory stand on shaky grounds. I subject this proposition to scrutiny. I begin by summarizing the major tenets of representation theory and agential realism. Next, I use agential realism to provide an account of phenomena that are associated with an accounting information systems case study. I then evaluate the account, particularly from the perspective of what novel, innovative insights occur by using an agential realism lens. Compared to existing theories such as actor-network theory and general systems theory, I conclude that little new is learned. Moreover, I argue that representation theory provides an alternative, robust account of the case-study phenomena. I also consider the question of whether agential realism potentially provides accounting information systems scholars with a means of identifying the core of their field and constructing theories about any core they might identify.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Contemporary urban theory has started to question the elevation of diversity as a panacea for enduring urban problems \textendash{} segregation, prejudice and intergroup hostility. This critique coincides with an opposite tendency within classic contact theory and research. The latter tradition has developed an increasing enthusiasm for face-to-face interaction. The contact hypothesis, which presupposes established contact, has received conclusive support independent of target groups and contact settings. Research on `lived diversity', which includes both contact and lack of contact, offers two supplementary insights. It shows, on the one hand, that boundaries are inscribed in social spaces. Physical proximity between ethnic and social groups tends to have a minor effect on interaction. Interaction, on the other hand, is not essential to attitude formation. Both subfields within contact research have confirmed that urban space may act as a catalyst for tolerant attitudes. This observation corresponds with increasing recognition of affective states, such as empathy, anxiety and group threat. Contact research has therefore, in summary, transcended the scope of the contact hypothesis. It has expanded into the realm of urban theory, which foreshadows future collaboration between the two traditions. Some key points for such exchange are suggested at the end of the article. Future research should combine an open-ended approach to casual contact with a diversified conception of diversity and a richer conception of urban space. A move in this direction would leave substantial space for geographical research.},

This critical review article introduces a new online contact strategy\textemdash Electronic- or E-contact\textemdash that allows for physically segregated ingroup and outgroup members to synchronously interact online, in a prestructured format. The synchronous nature of the intergroup interaction allows for the engagement of self in the contact situation that in turn strengthens the effectiveness of E-contact in promoting intergroup harmony. Previous research investigating online contact is reviewed, and an evaluation of a best-practice E-contact framework is provided. This framework is based on the successful 9-week Dual Identity Electronic Contact (DIEC) program that has been shown to maintain reductions in intergroup bias between Muslim and Christian students at 3 time periods: 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-DIEC intervention. Limitations of the Internet with regard to potentially creating negative contact are also highlighted to offer a balanced critique. Finally, future research designs are proposed to further support and enhance the success of E-contact research to improve intergroup relations and promote peace.},

Meanwhile, personal and professional communication has moved from face-to-face to computer-mediated environments, but there is little understanding on how the characteristics of these environments affect the quality of interaction and joint problem solving. To develop this understanding, methods are needed for measuring success of collaboration. For this purpose, we created a collaborative block design task intended to evaluate and quantify pair performance. In this task, participants need to share information to complete visuospatial puzzles. Two versions of the task are described: a physical version and one that can be completed in virtual reality. A preliminary study was conducted with the physical version (N = 18 pairs) and the results were used to develop the task for a second study in virtual reality (N = 31 pairs). Performance measures were developed for the task, and we found that pair performance was normally distributed and positively associated with visuospatial skills, but not with other participant-specific background factors. The task specifications are released for the research community to apply and adapt in the study of computer-mediated social interaction.},

  abstract = {Hybridity as the essence of puppetry is the key idea that is considered in the article. By reflecting upon aspects of in-betweenness in puppet performing practices, the conceptualization of puppetry's hybridity permits us to overcome a prevalent view that reduces puppetry in terms of binary oppositions such as human/non-human, living/lifeless, tangible/intangible. In this regard, a hybrid perspective of puppetry enables the exploration of the connection between performer and performing object as a synergistic relationship. The three areas discussed in the article manifest some of the major and most influential strategies of performing ontological hybridity in the puppetry of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The first case focuses on Tadeusz Kantor's bio-objects resulted in his theatre the genetically unique hybrid performer involved in creating the liminal, transgressive and subversive power of theatre. Based on contemporary puppet performances, the second part of the essay examines the ontological consequences of co-sharing and the interactive play of two bodies\textemdash the performer and the puppet. The final case deals with practices that merge puppeteering with complex forms of media, digital technologies and virtual environments. The article emphasizes the performative potential of perceptual multi-stability (after Erika Fisher-Lichte) produced by the hybrid puppet performing practices, resulting in the role of viewers as co-creators in puppetry hybridity.},

We show in this context that the Maximum Entropy paradigm for IRL lends itself naturally to the efficient training of deep architectures. At test time, the approach leads to a computational complexity independent of the number of demonstrations, which makes it especially well-suited for applications in life-long learning scenarios. Our approach achieves performance commensurate to the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks while exceeding on an alternative benchmark based on highly varying reward structures. Finally, we extend the basic architecture - which is equivalent to a simplified subclass of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with width one - to include larger convolutions in order to eliminate dependency on precomputed spatial features and work on raw input representations.},

@misc{yansoriConceptTraumaLacanian,
  title = {{The Concept of Trauma in Lacanian Psychoanalysis}},
  author = {Yansori, Ali},
  abstract = {``Trauma'' is one of those words about whose meaning there is no consensus; or, to use a Lacanian term, it functions as a point de capiton\textemdash that is to say, a word that everyone uses, yet it has no fixed meaning on which everyone agrees\textemdash and the constant usage of the word generates the illusion that everyone refers to the same phenomenon whenever the word ``trauma'' is mentioned. Not only has the general public's usage of the word nothing to do with how the word is used in psychoanalytic circles, but every psychoanalytic tradition has its own unique understanding of ``trauma.'' The aim of this article is to show what role trauma plays in Lacanian psychoanalysis. Psychoanalytic thought defines itself in very different terms, in terms of traumas and their persistence. \textemdash Lacan, 1992, p. 10 The Freudian Definition of Trauma Let's start by asking, ``What is trauma?'' The classic definition of the phenomenon can be found in Freud's works; and we could say that Lacan, as a Freudian, would have no general objection to Freud's following definition of ``trauma'': We describe as `traumatic' any excitations from outside which are powerful enough to break through the protective shield. It seems to me that the concept of trauma necessarily implies a connection of this kind with a breach in an otherwise efficacious barrier against stimuli. Such an event as an external trauma is bound to provoke a disturbance on a large scale in the functioning of the organism's energy and to set in motion every possible defensive measure (Freud, 1961, p. 23). Freud's definition appeals to the common sense, so much so that it makes sense even to the layman. And in general, when reading Lacan, we should always keep Freud's definition in mind; however, it needs to be said that Lacan, as usual, adds his own unique twists and turns to Freud's simple definition. Diverging from Freud Given Lacan's reliance on Freud, it is important to point out the relation between neurosis and trauma in Freudian psychoanalysis before we go any further. Freud claims that ``neurosis could [\ldots ] be equated with a traumatic illness and would come about owing to inability to deal with an experience whose affective colouring was excessively powerful'' (Freud, 1963, p. 275). If we accept the Lacanian assumption that there are no ``normal'' people, and that those whom we call normal are in fact neurotic, then it follows that everyone has their own trauma. This last point is crucial since according to Lacan, our traumas make us who we are. The idea that there is an essential substance which outlines our identity (or personality) is not foreign to Western thought; for Lacan, this essential substance is the traumatic kernel that each person possesses. An example from popular culture may help drive the point home: in the TV series Westworld, we find an excellent Lacanian instance of how traumas make us human; consider the following conversation between Bernard and Ford:  	BERNARD: Why would you give me this?  	FORD: A child?  	BERNARD: This child's death\ldots{} only a monster would force that onto someone. Why do I return to it over and over? It's my cornerstone, isn't it? The thing my whole identity is organised around\ldots{}  	FORD: Yes, Bernard. (Westworld, 2016) [Emphasis added.] This is textbook Lacanian psychoanalysis! It is as if Lacan himself had written the script. We need to keep two crucial points in mind when reading this dialogue: firstly, trauma is precisely the mentioned cornerstone that defines each person's identity; secondly, the words which are used to describe repetitive and circular motions\textemdash italicised in the text above\textemdash refer to the circular motion of the Trieb [drive] around an objet a. To push my argument further, it could even be argued that in the above dialogue, the word ``thing'' is not without significance: for Lacan, the Thing [la chose, or das Ding], just like objet a, is positioned beyond the Symbolic. As a matter of fact, the two terms are not unrelated: in Lacan's seminars, the concept ``das Ding'' gradually develops into the concept ``objet petit a.'' Repetition, Recollection, and Trauma In his Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, Lacan takes a Kierkegaardian approach to tell us what trauma is. For Kierkegaard, Wiederholung [repetition] and Erinnerung [recollection] are two sides of the same coin: ``Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward'' (Kierkegaard, 1983, p. 131). Lacan agrees that these two concepts are related, but only to a certain extent: the limit which Lacan sets for this backward repetition is the Real. In other words, the patient can recollect his past minus the traumatic events. The traumatic events are unsymbolised for the subject; therefore, the subject cannot possibly recall those events; no matter how hard the subject might try, they would not overcome the void created by the trauma they have undergone. Viewed from this perspective, Lacan's approach might not seem strictly Freudian; nevertheless, Freud had understood the limits of recollection despite claiming that ``hysterical symptoms can be resolved if, starting from them, we are able to find the path back to the memory of a traumatic experience'' (Freud, 1962, p. 195). Consider the following passage: ``It is true that in the earliest days of analytic technique we took an intellectualist view of the situation. We set a high value on the patient's knowledge of what he had forgotten, and in this we made hardly any distinction between our knowledge of it and his. We thought it a special piece of good luck if we were able to obtain information about the forgotten childhood trauma from other sources\textemdash for instance, from parents or nurses or the seducer himself\textemdash as in some cases it was possible to do; and we hastened to convey the information and the proofs of its correctness to the patient, in the certain expectation of thus bringing the neurosis and the treatment to a rapid end (Freud, 1958, p. 141). Here, we see strong similarities between the two thinkers. Freud had realised that secondary accounts of a traumatic event are far more reliable than the patient's own account of the event. In fact, if the patient did ``recall'' something, it would be nothing more than a fantasy woven by the patient himself\textemdash a case of false memory. This is where the repetitive motion of the Trieb around the object a comes into play, for this repetitive motion is directly related to trauma. Fantasy is created by the repetitive motion of the Trieb around the objet a: when some (traumatic) event disrupts the symbolic order, a void gets formed in the Symbolic; this void is better known as objet a, and trauma is the disruptive event during which ``the [objet] a is isolated by the Other and it is constituted as a remainder in the subject's relation to the Other'' (Lacan, 2014, p. 114). Thus, fantasy is created around a meaningless void, and its function is to produce the illusion of coherence; as a result, the traumatic event is perceived by the subject as something compatible with the rest of the subject's symbolic universe. With the help of fantasy, each person makes sense of their otherwise meaningless traumatic experience. Therefore, it is not the case that the subject recalls absolutely nothing; the subject does recall something, but this something is not the objective account of the traumatic event. For the subject, the traumatic event is literally non-sense [non-sens] and devoid of meaning. It is the function of fantasy to give meaning, or at least the illusion of meaningfulness, to the meaningless traumatic event: ``The place of the real [\ldots ] stretches from the trauma to the phantasy'' (1998, p. 60), and ``phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinant in the function of repetition'' (Lacan, 1998, p. 60). The Trauma of Birth In the TV series Westworld, Bernard was given a traumatic event to make him more humanlike, but you need not worry if your life is less traumatic than Bernard's\textemdash that doesn't make you less human than an android. According to Lacan, there is one essential and common trauma that we all share: in his Seminar X, Lacan goes so far as to suggest that getting born is a traumatic experience\textemdash he calls this ``le trauma de la naissance'' [the trauma of birth]. We all share this common trauma, because we all emerge into the same ``Other environment.'' The trauma of birth might make us human on a fundamental level, but it doesn't explain why we differ as individuals. If we want to know what makes us unique as individuals, we need to take into consideration the traumas people undergo after birth. Reference  	Freud, S. (1958).

  abstract = {We investigate the visual cross-embodiment imitation setting, in which agents learn policies from videos of other agents (such as humans) demonstrating the same task, but with stark differences in their embodiments -- shape, actions, end-effector dynamics, etc. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically discover and learn vision-based reward functions from cross-embodiment demonstration videos that are robust to these differences. Specifically, we present a self-supervised method for Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning (XIRL) that leverages temporal cycle-consistency constraints to learn deep visual embeddings that capture task progression from offline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing the same task differently due to embodiment differences. Prior to our work, producing rewards from self-supervised embeddings typically required alignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire under stark embodiment differences. We show empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task progress, simply taking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the learned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with reinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for embodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new embodiments. Additionally, when transferring real-world human demonstrations to a simulated robot, we find that XIRL is more sample efficient than current best methods. Qualitative results, code, and datasets are available at https://x-irl.github.io},

The interface provided a setting for face-to-face shared narration and support for the management of disagreements. The interface allows for escalation and de-escalation of the conflict emerging in the shared narration and requires that participants perform joint actions when a contribution to the story is to be removed from the overall narration. A between-subjects experiment compared the tabletop interface and a desktop multimedia interface with mixed pairs (male Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian-Arab youth). The results demonstrated that the experience with the tabletop interface appears to be motivating and, most importantly, produces at least a short-term shift of attitude toward the other.},

The interventions aim to encourage a change in attitudes of the participants towards each other. Typically, a human mediator is fundamental for achieving a successful intervention. In this work, we present an automated approach to support remote interactions between pairs of participants as they contribute to a shared story in their own language. A key component is an automated cognitive tutor that guides the participants through a controlled escalation/de-escalation process during the development of a joint narrative. We performed a controlled study comparing a trained human mediator to the automated mediator. The results demonstrate that an automated mediator, although simple at this stage, effectively supports interactions and helps to achieve positive outcomes comparable to those attained by the trained human mediator.},

  abstract = {Emotion recognition is a challenging task because of the emotional gap between subjective emotion and the low-level audio-visual features. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in bridging the semantic gap, this paper proposes to bridge the emotional gap based on a multimodal Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN), which fuses the audio and visual cues in a deep model. This multimodal DCNN is trained with two stages. First, two DCNN models pretrained on large-scale image data are fine-tuned to perform audio and visual emotion recognition tasks respectively on the corresponding labeled speech and face data. Second, the outputs of these two DCNNs are integrated in a fusion network constructed by a number of fully-connected layers. The fusion network is trained to obtain a joint audio-visual feature representation for emotion recognition. Experimental results on the RML audio-visual database demonstrates the promising performance of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is an early work fusing audio and visual cues in DCNN for emotion recognition. Its success guarantees further research in this direction.},

Additionally, I employed the autoethnographic method in order to fill in the gap where participation with informants' daily life was unreachable by documenting my personal experience during and beyond the Zoom class. Through a small sample of the target population, this paper captures a snapshot of people's initial adjustment to remote educational channels, particularly via Zoom meetings, and therefore provides helpful information in terms of creating resources and improving Zoom class experience for students and educators.},

Mode of copresence refers to the physical conditions that structure human interaction. Six such conditions are delineated. Sense of copresence, on the other hand, refers to the subjective experience of being with others that an individual acquires in interaction. The main argument of this paper is that mode of copresence affects sense of copresence, and knowledge of how the former affects the latter will benefit copresence design.},

Intuitive user control is achieved via a state machine controller based on signals from the integrated sensors to detect relative changes in hand-object interactions. Results from an initial evaluation with 3 participants with spinal cord injury (SCI), of varied injury levels and years since injury, wearing and controlling the glove show an average of 87\% improvement in grasping force, and improvements in functional assessments for participants with recent injuries. A significant variation in response suggests further investigation is required to understand the adaptation needed across different injury levels and durations since injury. Additionally, we evaluate the controller and find an average of 3 seconds from user initiations to completed grasps, and 10\% inadvertent grasp triggers and no false releases when objects are held.},

We conducted two groups of mutually blinded experiments, involving 29 participants in total. The data processing algorithm first reduces the spatial complexity to frame descriptors, and temporal features are calculated through basic statistical representations and wavelet analysis. Various classifiers are evaluated and the feature calculation algorithms are analyzed in details to determine each stage and segments' contribution. The best performing feature-classifier combination can recognize the gestures with a 93.3\% accuracy from a known group of participants, and 89.1\% from strangers.},
