# Introduction

## The Contact Hypothesis
 * History of the four condition[@pettigrewAllportIntergroupContact2005]
    

 * Advancements since Allport.
    [@kenworthyIntergroupContactWhen2005;@brownIntegrativeTheoryIntergroup2005]

    * **Contact should focus on the combination between forming a personal connection and maintaining group salience and representation**.

    * anxiety and other emotions play an important role.
    

    * Long-term effects, meta-analytics 
    [@pettigrewMetaanalyticTestIntergroup2006]

    * Different types of contact (Direct/indirect, structured/unstructured, extended/vicarious..?).

    [@amichai-hamburgerStructuredUnstructuredIntergroup2015;@vezzaliImprovingIntergroupRelations2014]


## Robotic telepresence
* History and current uses of robotic telepresence [@tsuiExploringUseCases2011].
    * Social robots: health, education, day-to-day communication
    * Industry robots: surgical, factory.
    * Examples from Japan and my MA.

* Terminology and the asymmetry of telepresence
Telepresence communication is by nature asymmetrical, in a sense that the experience of signal transmission is very different than that of reception. Transmission is mediated through a control interface but reception immediate in a shared physical space. Terminology:
    * Controller: controller of the robot.
    * Interlocutor: Person interacting with the robot. 

* About the senses of presence, agency, and ownership.
    * From my MA

* About intercorporeality 
    * From my MA


# Robotic telepresence as a medium for contact 

## Mediatization of politics
* Mediatization of the lifeworld changes the nature of politics and political discussion [@heppMediatizedWorldsUnderstanding2014;@thimmMediatizedPoliticsStructures2014]    


## Online and virtual mediation
* Review of online and virtual contact attempts, advantages and disadvantages [@ho2008social;@sassenberg2005attitude;@haslerOnlineIntergroupContact2013;@robinsonCyberselfSelfingProject2007;@haslerOnlineIntergroupContact2013;@postmesSocialInfluenceComputerMediated2001;@amichai-hamburgerContactHypothesisReconsidered2006]

* Mention immersive environments

## Telepresence as a midway
* On the controller side, telepresence provides the benefits of online communication: accessibility, anonymity, re-embodiment, along with disadvantages regarding the dis-association of ownership.
* On the interlocutor side there are some of the benefits of face-to-face conversation, intercorporeality

# Intergroup power relations 

## Strategies of status
* Does the contact situation need to:
    * reflect existing power relations (to avoid subtyping)?
    * 'normalize' them, to increase friendship and reduce anxiety? 
    * reverse the power relations for empowerment and empathy?

[@maozDoesContactWork2011;@@shnabelNeedsbasedModelReconciliation2008;@saguyRoleGroupPower2013]

## Different conformations of telepresence contact:
    * Person <-> Robot <-> Robot <-> Person
    * Person -> Robot <-> Person
    * Person, Person -> Robot
    * Person <-> Person with Robot.

# Group salience: how to increase via telepresence robots?

## Group markers via custom robot design.
* Include group-identifying markers in the robot design, or encourage group members to include them in their own custom design. [@suguitanBlossomHandcraftedOpenSource2019] 

## Interaction content
* Anonymity vs self-disclosure? _Is the real person behind the robot is perceived as a protoypical palestinian or not and what is revealed about the person_

* Encourage conflict related interaction?  


# Emotional and personal connection with telepresence robots.

## On the controller side: Reduction of anxiety via anonymity and imagery

* Same from online interaction [@haslerOnlineIntergroupContact2013;@postmesSocialInfluenceComputerMediated2001;@sassenberg2005attitude].

* Addition of re-embodied avatar imagery 

* Therapeutic material engagement if you make your own avatar
    [@marchPlayingClayUncertainty2019;@sholtTherapeuticQualitiesClaywork2006]

* Bodily Expression 

## On the interlocutor side: Physical interaction and intimacy

* Touch and cognition 
    [@influsSocialNeuroscienceApproach2018;@feldmanMaternalPretermSkintoSkinContact2014;@goodwinHapticSociality2017]

* Uncanny valley and anxiety
[@moriUncannyValleyField2012]



#  Design considerations

## Appearance: Human vs nonhuman
* More about the uncanny?


## Materiality and movement
* Importance of movement
[@hoffmanDesigningRobotsMovement2014]
* Soft robotics


## The importance of feedback
* Audio and visual feedback for actions
[@caldwellTelepresenceVisualAudio1994;@dolezalRemoteBodyPhenomenology2009]

## Autonomous vs controlled functions
    * AI and Augmentation vs Expressiveness and intentionality


# Real-world conflict considerations

## Empowerment via education in robotics
## Legal and ethical considerations
## Israel-Palestine test case

# Conclusions
