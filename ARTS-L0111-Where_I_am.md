# Topic: Intergroup contact via telerobtic puppetry
## Foundation
The theoretical foundation for the research stems from the principles of intergroup contact outlined by Gordon Allport in the 1954 seminal work _The Nature of Prejudice_ [-@allportNaturePrejudice1954]. The premise of Allport's theory is that the first step to reducing prejudice between groups is to enable _contact_ between them, he then specifies conditions to be fulfilled during positive intergroup contact: equal status, having common goals, active cooperation, and institutional support. The primary social field for this research is the long-term conflict in my home country, Israel, with its Palestinian neighbors. 

Since face-to-face contact can be challenging to implement, particularly in areas of violent conflict, recent projects have used technology (especially online communication) to facilitate intergroup encounters [@amichai-hamburgerStructuredUnstructuredIntergroup2015;@haslerOnlineIntergroupContact2013;@waltherComputermediatedCommunicationReduction2015]. However, online contact is not always constructive, and may result in a negative outcome and increased prejudice. The remote nature of the medium makes participants less accountable for their actions and less engaged in the conversation [@whiteImprovingIntergroupRelations2015;@schumannWhenComputermediatedIntergroup2017]. The lack of nonverbal cues [@burgoonNonverbalSignals1994] obstructs the path to a mutual understanding and impairs the turn-taking process, which may evoke negative feelings between the group members, such as anger and frustration [@johnsonAngerFlamingComputermediated2009].

Despite the inherent abstraction in virtual mediums and the widely recognized role of the body in forming social cognition [@deweyExperienceEducation1986;@merleau-pontyPhenomenologyPerception2013;@gallagherHowBodyShapes2006;@malafourisHowThingsShape2013], little attention has been given to robots as a tool for intergroup contact. Remote-controlled robots (telerobots) may add corporeal depth to mediated contact, situating a midpoint between online communication and a face-to-face meeting. The proposed research investigates how robots could facilitate contact between groups in conflict. As a prelude to this research, a position paper titled "The Potential of Telepresence Robots for Intergroup Contact" was presented at the 4th International Conference on Computer-Human Interaction Research and Applications [@peledPotentialTelepresenceRobots2020]. The paper presents the conceptual framework of robotic intergroup encounters (termed the “robotic telepresence contact hypothesis”), and lists potential opportunities and pitfalls with regard to the first implementation of telepresence-based intergroup contact.

## Telerobotic Puppetry
Telerobotics, or even virtual presence, share a core element with traditional puppetry - Hybridity. The mediating avatar assumes a hybrid role between object and subject, medium and avatar. A puppet lives in the liminal space between its body and that of the puppeteer [@wisniewskaHybridityPuppetry2020]. A new identity is formed in that in-between space. A result of audience perception and the ontological presence of the puppet. The hybrid space absorbs prejudice and problematizes it. It encourages the performance of group identity (an important ingredient of _contact_), much like online communication [see: SIDE theory in @spearsWhenAreNet2002]. In a Lacanian sense, a discourse, interaction, or assimilation of a puppet may facilitate relief from trauma [@lacanFourFundamentalConcepts1998]. In the tradition of political puppet theater [@krugerPuppetsPoliticsFinding2016], this research will use telerobotic puppetry as means for intergroup contact. 

# Current ongoing research 
## Telerobot contact user survey
An online user survey was designed to evaluate the readiness and acceptance of telerobotic communication in the general public of Israel and Palestine. In the upcoming weeks, the survey will be launched simultaneously in Israel and Palestine with the facilitation of survey companies. The survey would include 240 participants in each population, divided into 4 age groups of 60 participants (30 male, 30 female). The survey contains general common questions regarding attitudes toward robots, questions specific to telerobotic communication, and will measure variation in regards to Israel-Palestinian communication. Additionally, initial thoughts on the possibility of a shared telerobotic puppetry experience will be collected. The results of the survey would be part of a wider journal article defining the telerobotic contact hypothesis.

## Soft textile-based robotic puppets
Research is underway to develop textile-based, pneumatic, robotic puppets. In a collaboration with Emmi Pouta [@poutaHandPuppetMeans2019] and the Aalto Cloud Computing department, smart textile, glove-sensing, and soft actuating puppets are being developed. The research is based on work at Harvard by Zhou et al. [-@zhouSoftRoboticGlove2019] and inspired by former robotic puppetry research [@jwu-shenghuGlovePuppetRobot2008].

# Future research
Following the production phase, workshops would be conducted in Finland, Israel, and Palestine, and qualitatively analyzed through pre/post-session interviews and observations made in the field. The goal would be to produce a political puppet theater where the participants can fabricate their puppets. Work would follow principles of _Constructive Design Research_, [@koskinenDesignResearchPractice2011] combining lab-work with participatory practices and ethnographic fieldwork.
