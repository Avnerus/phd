Sentiments for the (translated) question:
_Imagine you would have the opportunity to interact with a robot that is operated by a person in another location. 
How would that compare to meeting a person face-to-face?_

```{r}
sentiments <- Telerobot_sorted %>% 
  select("v","Q_TELEROBOT_VS_F2F_TRANS") %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, "Q_TELEROBOT_VS_F2F_TRANS") %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(v, sentiment) %>%
  group_by(v)  %>%
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n))

ggplot(sentiments,aes(x=sentiment, y=freq, color=v)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  facet_wrap(~ v) 

```
