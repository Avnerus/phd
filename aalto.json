  {"id":"al-ghaithUnderstandingSocialNetwork2015","abstract":"This study examines individuals’ intentions and behaviour on Social Networking Sites (SNSs). The study proposed model asserts that “Co-presence”, “Intimacy”, “Immediacy”, “Perceived Enjoyment”, and “Perceived ease of use” formed individuals' “Attitude” towards “behavioral intention” to use SNSs. The results support all formulated hypotheses. The proposed model in this study explains 69% of individual’s attitude or feelings towards adoption the SNSs, 59% of the variance in “Behavioral Intention” and 54% of the variance in “Usage Behaviour”. The present study has shown the importance of social presence’s factors, namely co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy, in explaining individuals’ intentions and behavior. The study findings confirmed that social presence positively influence SNS usage indirectly through user attitude, and as aforementioned that three factors, namely co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy are framing the construct of social presence. Thus, this study is the first empirical effort to examine the impact of co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy in determining intention or behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Al-Ghaith","given":"Waleed"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications","container-title-short":"ijacsa","DOI":"10.14569/IJACSA.2015.060813","ISSN":"21565570, 2158107X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding Social Network Usage: Impact of Co-Presence, Intimacy, and Immediacy","title-short":"Understanding Social Network Usage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=6&Issue=8&Code=ijacsa&SerialNo=13","volume":"6"},

Avatar identification is one potential moderator. We integrated three lines of research on moral disengagement, moral foundations, and avatar identification to conceptually replicate and extend previous studies on video games and morality. We used a 2 (justification: unjustified vs. justified violence) x 2 (avatar: high vs. low identification) between-participants experiment with guilt, moral cleansing, and post-play sacredness of the care and fairness foundations as moral outcomes. Participants (N = 233) also completed measures of morally-relevant traits before gameplay. Participants felt guiltier after unjustified (vs. justified) violence. People with high trait levels of care foundation salience and personal distress also felt guiltier. Unjustified (vs. justified) violence did not affect the other moral outcomes. Avatar identification did not moderate the effects of unjustified violence, but this is likely because participants identified less with their avatars after engaging in unjustified violence. This unexpected effect suggests that players distance themselves from immoral avatars.

  {"id":"alves-oliveiraGuideBuildYOLO2019","abstract":"YOLO is a non-anthropomorphic social robot designed to stimulate creativity in children. This robot was envisioned to be used by children during free-play where they use the robot as a character for the stories they create. During play, YOLO makes use of creativity techniques that promote the creation of new story-lines. Therefore, the robot serves as a tool that has the potential to stimulate creativity in children during the interaction. Particularly, YOLO can stimulate divergent and convergent thinking for story creations. Additionally, YOLO can have different personalities, providing it with socially intelligent and engaging behaviors. This work provides open-source and open-access of YOLO’s hardware. The design of the robot was guided by psychological theories and models on creativity, design research including user-centered design practices with children, and informed by expert working in the field of creativity. Specifically, we relied on established theories of personality to inform the social behavior of the robot, and on theories of creativity to design creativity stimulating behaviors. Our design decisions were then based on design fieldwork with children. The end product is a robot that communicates using non-verbal expressive modalities (lights and movements) equipped with sensors that detect the playful behaviors of children. YOLO has the potential to be used as a research tool for academic studies, and as a toy for the community to engage in personal fabrication. The overall benefit of this proposed hardware is that it is open-source, less expensive than existing ones, and one that children can build by themselves under expert supervision.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Alves-Oliveira","given":"Patrícia"},{"family":"Arriaga","given":"Patrícia"},{"family":"Paiva","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Guy"}],"container-title":"HardwareX","container-title-short":"HardwareX","DOI":"10.1016/j.ohx.2019.e00074","ISSN":"2468-0672","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e00074","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Guide to build YOLO, a creativity-stimulating robot for children","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067218300890","volume":"6"},

One of the leading theories advocated for conﬂict resolution and prevention is the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1954). According to this theory, contact under certain conditions will create a positive intergroup encounter, which in turn, will reduce prejudice and discrimination, and bring about an improvement in intergroup relations. Although the Internet has become an accessible and pivotal medium of communication there are surprisingly few projects that make use of its potential for bridging between groups in conﬂict. This article explains how the Internet’s unique qualities may help overcome the major obstacles inherent in the Contact Hypothesis. In doing so, it differentiates between structured and unstructured online intergroup contact, and provides an analysis of some of the leading online intergroup contact platforms, both past and present.

  {"id":"andersenAcceptanceResistanceSocioTechnical2016","abstract":"Through a socio-technical approach and based on abductive case study analysis, this work explores the antecedents of differences in ICT use between two different employee groups in the same organizations. Prior to the large-scale implementation of a complex ERP system, one of the groups consisted of experienced ICT users, while the other consisted of inexperienced users. The signiﬁcance of the nature of the interplay between task-technology ﬁt, the leadership and the ICT-organization integration processes, and employees’ levels of self-determination, is investigated in relation to different user practices, and in particular, how it may institutionalize involuntary non-use for the group of inexperienced employees. Previous experience is a moderating variable, together with participation and interaction possibilities in everyday work. In a perspective of sociomateriality where user practices are seen as developing through situated everyday actions and interactions, the relationship between demands, control and support and inherent need satisfaction is elaborated. This study shows that employees’ use or non-use of new ICT has to do with how leadership behaviors affect the ICT-organization integration process and its outcomes, and how this process may serve the experienced employee group over the inexperienced, and as such contribute to involuntary non-use of new ICT for the latter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Thale Kvernberg"}],"container-title":"Systemic Practice and Action Research","container-title-short":"Syst Pract Action Res","DOI":"10.1007/s11213-015-9360-5","ISSN":"1094-429X, 1573-9295","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,6]]},"language":"en","page":"183-213","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Beyond Acceptance and Resistance: A Socio-Technical Approach to the Exploration of Intergroup Differences in ICT Use and Non-use at Work","title-short":"Beyond Acceptance and Resistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11213-015-9360-5","volume":"29"},

We present, what is to our knowledge, the ﬁrst HRI study of tactile conveyance of both positive and negative emotions (affective touch) on the Nao robot, and based on an experimental set-up from a study of human–human tactile communication. In the present work, participants conveyed eight emotions to a small humanoid robot via touch. We found that female participants conveyed emotions for a longer time, using more varied interaction and touching more regions on the robot’s body, compared to male participants. Several differences between emotions were found such that emotions could be classiﬁed by the valence of the emotion conveyed, by combining touch amount and duration. Overall, these results show high agreement with those reported for human–human affective tactile communication and could also have impact on the design and placement of tactile sensors on humanoid robots.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Andreasson","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Alenljung","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Billing","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Robert"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Social Robotics","container-title-short":"Int J of Soc Robotics","DOI":"10.1007/s12369-017-0446-3","ISSN":"1875-4791, 1875-4805","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9]]},"language":"en","page":"473-491","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Affective Touch in Human–Robot Interaction: Conveying Emotion to the Nao Robot","title-short":"Affective Touch in Human–Robot Interaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12369-017-0446-3","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"aucouturierCheekChipDancing2008","abstract":"Recent generations of humanoid robots increasingly resemble humans in shape and articulatory capacities. This progress has motivated researchers to design dancing robots that can mimic the complexity and style of human choreographic dancing. Such complicated actions are usually programmed manually and ad hoc. However, this approach is both tedious and inflexible. Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed the learning-from-observation (LFO) training method to overcome this difficulty.1-2 LFO enables a robot to acquire knowledge of what to do and how to do it from observing human demonstrations. Direct mapping from human joint angles to robot joint angles doesn't work well because of the dynamic and kinematic differences between the observed person and the robot (for example, weight, balance, and arm and leg lengths). LFO therefore relies on predesigned task models, which represent only the actions (and features thereof) that are essential to mimicry. Then it adapts these actions to the robot's morphology and dynamics so that it can mimic the movement. This indirect, two-step mapping is crucial for robust imitation and performance.","author":[{"family":"Aucouturier","given":"Jean-Julien"},{"family":"Ikeuchi","given":"Katsushi"},{"family":"Hirukawa","given":"Hirohisa"},{"family":"Nakaoka","given":"Shin'ichiro"},{"family":"Shiratori","given":"Takaaki"},{"family":"Kudoh","given":"Shunsuke"},{"family":"Kanehiro","given":"Fumio"},{"family":"Ogata","given":"Tetsuya"},{"family":"Kozima","given":"Hideki"},{"family":"Okuno","given":"Hiroshi G."},{"family":"Michalowski","given":"Marek P."},{"family":"Ogai","given":"Yuta"},{"family":"Ikegami","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Kosuge","given":"Kazuhiro"},{"family":"Takeda","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Hirata","given":"Yasuhisa"}],"container-title":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1109/MIS.2008.22","ISSN":"1941-1294","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3]]},"page":"74-84","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Cheek to Chip: Dancing Robots and AI's Future","title-short":"Cheek to Chip","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"azevedoWhenLensToo","abstract":"Photojournalistic images shape our understanding of sociopolitical events. How humans are depicted in images may have far-reaching consequences for our attitudes towards them. Here, we focus on the visual depiction of refugees to understand how exposure to the dominant visual framing used in the media, depicting them in large groups of faceless individuals, affects their dehumanization and sets off political consequences. Seeing images of large groups resulted in greater implicit dehumanization compared with images depicting small groups. Moreover, after viewing images of large groups, participants showed increased preference for more dominant, less trustworthy political leaders and supported less prorefugee policies and more anti-refugee policies. Lastly, the extent to which participants felt reduced pity for images depicting large groups mediated the effect of visual framing on the choice of more authoritarian leaders. What we see in the media and how it is shown has attitudinal, behavioural as well as political consequences.","author":[{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Ruben T"}],"language":"en","page":"31","source":"Zotero","title":"When the lens is too wide: the political consequences of the visual dehumanisation of refugees","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"backonjaComfortAttitudesRobots2018","abstract":"Purpose: To explore the social impact of, comfort with, and negative attitudes towards robots among young, middle-­aged, and older adults in the United States. Design: Descriptive, cross-­sectional. Conducted in 2014–2015 in an urban area of the western United States using a purposive sample of adults 18 years of age or older.\nMethods: Respondents completed a survey that included the Negative Attitudes Toward Robots Scale (NARS) and two questions taken or modified from the European Commission’s Autonomous System 2015 Report. Analyses were conducted to compare perceptions and demographic factors by age groups (young adults:18–44, middle-aged adults: 45–64, and older adults: >65 years old). Findings: Sample included 499 individuals (n = 322 age 18–44 years, n = 50 age 45–64 years, and n = 102 age 65–98 years). There were no significant differences between age groups for 9 of the 11 items regarding social impact of robots and comfort with robots. There were no significant differences by age groups for 9 of the 14 items in the NARS. Among those items with statistically significant differences, the mean scores indicate similar sentiments for each group.\nConclusions: Older, middle-­aged, and younger adults had similar attitudes regarding the social impact of and comfort with robots; they also had similar negative attitudes towards robots. Findings dispel current perceptions that older adults are not as receptive to robots as other adults. This has implications for nurses who integrate supportive robots in their practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Backonja","given":"Uba"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Amanda K."},{"family":"Painter","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Kneale","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Lazar","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Cakmak","given":"Maya"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Hilaire J."},{"family":"Demiris","given":"George"}],"container-title":"Journal of Nursing Scholarship","container-title-short":"Journal of Nursing Scholarship","DOI":"10.1111/jnu.12430","ISSN":"1527-6546, 1547-5069","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11]]},"language":"en","page":"623-633","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Comfort and Attitudes Towards Robots Among Young, Middle‐Aged, and Older Adults: A Cross‐Sectional Study","title-short":"Comfort and Attitudes Towards Robots Among Young, Middle‐Aged, and Older Adults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jnu.12430","volume":"50"},
  {"id":"bailensonNonverbalOverloadTheoretical2021","abstract":"For decades, scholars have predicted that videoconference technology will disrupt the practice of commuting daily to and from work and will change the way people socialize. In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a drastic increase in the number of videoconference meetings, and Zoom became the leading software package because it was free, robust, and easy to use. While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term “Zoom Fatigue” caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bailenson","given":"Jeremy N."}],"container-title":"Technology, Mind, and Behavior","DOI":"10.1037/tmb0000030","ISSN":",","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,23]]},"language":"en","publisher":"PubPub","source":"tmb.apaopen.org","title":"Nonverbal Overload: A Theoretical Argument for the Causes of Zoom Fatigue","title-short":"Nonverbal Overload","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/nonverbal-overload/release/1","volume":"2"},

In particular, the connection between player and avatar is understood as influencing a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioral play phenomena. Divergent approaches examine this connection from both parasocial (one-way, non-dialectical) and social (two-way, dialectical) perspectives. This study examined how player–avatar connections may be better understood by integrating an existing parasocial approach (character attachment [CA]) with a social approach (player–avatar relationships [PARs]). A quantitative linguistic analysis of massively multiplayer online game (MMO) player interviews revealed statistically robust associations among language patterns, dimensions of CA, and PAR types. Validating and extending prior research, findings highlight the importance of selfdifferentiation and anthropomorphization in suspending disbelief so that the avatar may be taken as a fully social agent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Banks","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Nicholas David"}],"container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444814554898","ISSN":"1461-4448, 1461-7315","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"language":"en","page":"1257-1276","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Avatars are (sometimes) people too: Linguistic indicators of parasocial and social ties in player–avatar relationships","title-short":"Avatars are (sometimes) people too","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444814554898","volume":"18"},

The formal termination of such a conflict begins with the elimination of the perceived incompatibility between the opposing parties through negotiation by their representatives—that is, a conflict resolution process. But this is only part of the long-term reconciliation process, which requires the formation of peaceful relations based on mutual trust and acceptance, cooperation, and consideration of mutual needs. The psychological aspect of reconciliation requires a change in the conflictive ethos, especially with respect to societal beliefs about group goals, about the adversary group, about the ingroup, about intergroup relations, and about the nature of peace. In essence, psychological reconciliation requires the formation of an ethos of peace, but this is extremely difficult in cases of intractable conflict. Political psychologists can and should work to improve the state of knowledge about reconciliation, which until now has received much less attention than conflict resolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Bar‐Tal","given":"Daniel"}],"container-title":"Political Psychology","container-title-short":"Political Psychology","DOI":"10.1111/0162-895X.00192","ISSN":"0162-895X, 1467-9221","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,6]]},"language":"en","page":"351-365","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From Intractable Conflict Through Conflict Resolution To Reconciliation: Psychological Analysis","title-short":"From Intractable Conflict Through Conflict Resolution To Reconciliation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0162-895X.00192","volume":"21"},

While ANT was originally rooted in Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approaches, ANT has become a theoretical framework commonly used by scholars in numerous disciplines beyond STS, including Information Sciences. Although some scholars consider ANT to be now closer to sociomateriality studies, we claim that ANT differs from sociomateriality in that it suggests a different notion of power. In ANT, power results from actors’ associations enacted into being rather than the sociomateriality claim that power results from existing power structures. We draw from our work on information technologies and social movements to illustrate this important distinction, and to show how ANT can be further strengthened by including the study of histories, memories and trajectories, in order to better understand power relations as associations enacted into being. In this way, we offer a deeper understanding of ANT and its utility for STS research in general, and information studies in particular.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Baron","given":"Luis Fernando"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Ricardo"}],"container-title":"Science, Technology and Society","container-title-short":"Science, Technology and Society","DOI":"10.1177/0971721816640615","ISSN":"0971-7218","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"129-148","publisher":"SAGE Publications India","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Associations between Technologies and Societies: The Utility of Actor-Network Theory","title-short":"The Associations between Technologies and Societies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0971721816640615","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"beedholmDiscourseAnalysisImpact2014","abstract":"Discourse analysis has been introduced into nursing research as an approach which has the potential to offer new perspectives and to pose new questions to taken-for-granted assumptions. However, critique has arisen that when applied to nursing studies, the epistemological foundation of the discourse analysis is often overlooked. It is furthermore claimed that the methodological inspiration does not lead to any new insights and that these studies can hardly be differentiated from more traditional studies. This study supports this critique, arguing that the challenges of implementing discourse analysis in nursing research reﬂect a dominant pattern of thought in the discourse of the nursing profession that have held sway throughout the last century. We argue that this pattern of thought stems from the Western philosophy of consciousness and the conception of the sovereign subject. By applying a discourse analytical perspective to the discourse of the nursing profession itself, this study elucidates the challenges of applying discourse analysis in nursing research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Beedholm","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Lomborg","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Frederiksen","given":"Kirsten"}],"container-title":"Nursing Inquiry","container-title-short":"Nurs Inq","DOI":"10.1111/nin.12034","ISSN":"13207881","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,6]]},"language":"en","page":"112-120","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Discourse analysis and the impact of the philosophy of Enlightenment in nursing research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/nin.12034","volume":"21"},

Members of the intervention classes engaged in ECEP's activities, whereas members of the control classes engaged in a social–emotional learning program. The program's outcomes were measured a week before, immediately after, and 15 months following termination. Results showed that the ECEP decreased stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward the other group and increased positive feelings and readiness for social contact with the other group upon program termination. Additionally, the effects of the ECEP were generalized to an ethnic group (i.e., Ethiopians) with whom the ECEP's participants did not have any contact. Finally, the ECEP retained its signiﬁcant effect 15 months after the program's termination, despite the serious clashes between Israel and the Palestinians that occurred during that time. This empirical support for the ECEP'S utility in reducing prejudice makes it potentially applicable to other areas in the world, especially those that are characterized by ethnic tension and violent conﬂicts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger","given":"Rony"},{"family":"Benatov","given":"Joy"},{"family":"Abu-Raiya","given":"Hisham"},{"family":"Tadmor","given":"Carmit T."}],"container-title":"Journal of School Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of School Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsp.2016.04.003","ISSN":"00224405","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"language":"en","page":"53-72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Reducing prejudice and promoting positive intergroup attitudes among elementary-school children in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022440516300097","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"bianchiFabricBasedApproachWearable2016","abstract":"In recent years, wearable haptic systems (WHS) have gained increasing attention as a novel and exciting paradigm for human–robot interaction (HRI). These systems can be worn by users, carried around, and integrated in their everyday lives, thus enabling a more natural manner to deliver tactile cues. At the same time, the design of these types of devices presents new issues: the challenge is the correct identiﬁcation of design guidelines, with the two-fold goal of minimizing system encumbrance and increasing the effectiveness and naturalness of stimulus delivery. Fabrics can represent a viable solution to tackle these issues.

  {"id":"blazquezcanoInfluenceImageInteractivity2017","abstract":"Touch screens are a key component of consumer mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, as well as an increasingly common self-service component of information retrieval on ﬁxed screens and mobile devices in-store. The ubiquity of touch screens in daily life increases consumer accessibility and extended use for shopping, whilst software innovations have increased the functionality of touch screens, for example the extent to which images respond to ﬁngertip control. This study examines how users engage with interactive visual rotation and tactile simulation features while browsing fashion clothing products on touch screen devices and thus contributes to retail touch screen research that previously focused on in-store kiosks and window displays. Findings show that three dimensions of user engagement (endurability, novelty and felt involvement) are positively inﬂuenced by both forms of manipulation. In order to examine the extent to which touch screen user engagement varies with individual preferences for an in-store experience, the paper also examines whether user engagement outcomes are mediated by an individual's need for physical touch. Findings indicate that the need for touch does not explain the variance between individuals. We conclude that touch screen technology complements the physical retail environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Blazquez Cano","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Perry","given":"Patsy"},{"family":"Ashman","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Waite","given":"Kathryn"}],"container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.042","ISSN":"07475632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"language":"en","page":"406-412","source":"Crossref","title":"The influence of image interactivity upon user engagement when using mobile touch screens","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563217301991","volume":"77"},

  {"id":"bossiHumanBrainReveals2020","abstract":"The increasing presence of robots in society necessitates a deeper understanding into what attitudes people have toward robots. People may treat robots as mechanistic artifacts or may consider them to be intentional agents. This might result in explaining robots’ behavior as stemming from operations of the mind (intentional interpretation) or as a result of mechanistic design (mechanistic interpretation). Here, we examined whether individual attitudes toward robots can be differentiated on the basis of default neural activity pattern during resting state, measured with electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants observed scenarios in which a humanoid robot was depicted performing various actions embedded in daily contexts. Before they were introduced to the task, we measured their resting state EEG activity. We found that resting state EEG beta activity differentiated people who were later inclined toward interpreting robot behaviors as either mechanistic or intentional. This pattern is similar to the pattern of activity in the default mode network, which was previously demonstrated to have a social role. In addition, gamma activity observed when participants were making decisions about a robot’s behavior indicates a relationship between theory of mind and said attitudes. Thus, we provide evidence that individual biases toward treating robots as either intentional agents or mechanistic artifacts can be detected at the neural level, already in a resting state EEG signal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bossi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Willemse","given":"Cesco"},{"family":"Cavazza","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Marchesi","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Murino","given":"Vittorio"},{"family":"Wykowska","given":"Agnieszka"}],"container-title":"Science Robotics","container-title-short":"Sci.

However, previous studies used restricted operationalizations of generalized prejudice that only assessed prejudice toward disadvantaged groups. In this paper, we explored a) whether Big Five trait-personality relationships observed under restricted operationalizations of generalized prejudice extend to an inclusive operationalization of generalized prejudice, and b) whether the relationship between personality and prejudice is moderated by certain group characteristics. Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to inclusive generalized prejudice, r = -.03, 95%CI [-.07, -.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with inclusive generalized prejudice (r = -.23, 95%CI [-.31, -.16]). Several target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice; importantly, however, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups. These results provide new and more nuanced insights into the relationship between personality and prejudice.","author":[{"family":"Brandt","given":"Mark J"}],"language":"en","page":"36","source":"Zotero","title":"The College of New Jersey","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"bremnerPersonalityPerceptionRobot2017","abstract":"Humanoid robot avatars are a potential new telecommunication tool, whereby a user is remotely represented by a robot that replicates their arm, head, and possible face movements. They have been shown to have a number of benefits over more traditional media such as phones or video calls. However, using a teleoperated humanoid as a communication medium inherently changes the appearance of the operator, and appearance-based stereotypes are used in interpersonal judgments (whether consciously or unconsciously). One such judgment that plays a key role in how people interact is personality. Hence, we have been motivated to investigate if and how using a robot avatar alters the perceived personality of teleoperators. To do so, we carried out two studies where participants performed 3 communication tasks, solo in study one and dyadic in study two, and were recorded on video both with and without robot mediation. Judges recruited using online crowdsourcing services then made personality judgments of the participants in the video clips. We observed that judges were able to make internally consistent trait judgments in both communication conditions. However, judge agreement was affected by robot mediation, although which traits were affected was highly task dependent. Our most important finding was that in dyadic tasks personality trait perception was shifted to incorporate cues relating to the robot’s appearance when it was used to communicate. Our findings have important implications for telepresence robot design and personality expression in autonomous robots.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bremner","given":"Paul Adam"},{"family":"Celiktutan","given":"Oya"},{"family":"Gunes","given":"Hatice"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI","container-title-short":"Front.

During the Israel Palestine conflict, the primary form of movement restriction that has been documented is closure to day migrant workers of the borders between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In recent years, however, restrictions on movement throughout the West Bank have been applied to the general Palestinian population. International accompaniment work has endeavoured to resist such restrictions and to escape the limitations of traditional human rights documentation. In doing so, it presents alternative views: of the population as more than ‘worker’; and the impact of restrictions on both the individual and the collective. It also demonstrates the material, emotional and cultural aspects of movement. Observation emerges as a principal form of resistance. This suggests that restrictions can be seen as discipline in Foucault’s sense. The West Bank experience, however, is better characterized by a negative rather than the positive conception of discipline associated with the productive control of labour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Alison P."}],"container-title":"Social & Legal Studies","container-title-short":"Social & Legal Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0964663904047331","ISSN":"0964-6639","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"501-521","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Immobile Mass: Movement Restrictions in the West Bank","title-short":"The Immobile Mass","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0964663904047331","volume":"13"},

As an example of post-Kantian philosophy, Serres critiques the classical logic of identity as based on a ‘third man’ argument. This third space – personified as the parasite – is essential to thinking communication and transformation in systems. Parasitism operates through the logic of taking without giving or ‘abuse value’. But the parasite nevertheless makes exchange possible by creating connections between otherwise incommensurable forms of ordering. Human relations oscillate through period of disequilibrium, often involving scapegoating and exclusion, as parasitic cascades emerge. However, parasites in the form of jokers and quasi-objects create powerful mechanisms for creating collectivity and individuality.

Unfortunately, conflicting and ambiguous definitions of these concepts, along with inadequate differentiation from other patterns such as matching, convergence, divergence, and complementarity have hindered theoretical and empirical progress. This article is dedicated to sorting out the differences among the various accommodation processes and offering appropriate constitutive definitions and operationalizations. It is proposed that definitions of reciprocity and compensation be distinguished from matching and complementarity in that the former incorporate principles of(1) directedness, (2) contingency, (3) both unidirectional and mutual influence, (4) change rather than maintenance, (5) directionality rather than magnitude of change, (6) intentional and automatic processes, and (7) functional equivalence of behaviors. Operationally, these criteria imply a focus on designs demonstrating causality or strong association between partner behaviors, concatenous and lagged responses, within-dyad and longitudinal analyses, and, for many purposes, a more molar perspective. Issues of macro versus micro measurement, perceived versus actual reciprocity and compensation, and reliance on observer versus participant perspectives are also considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Burgoon","given":"Judee K."},{"family":"Dillman","given":"Leesa"},{"family":"Stem","given":"Lesa A."}],"container-title":"Communication Theory","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-2885.1993.tb00076.x","ISSN":"1468-2885","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1993.tb00076.x","page":"295-316","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Adaptation in Dyadic Interaction: Defining and Operationalizing Patterns of Reciprocity and Compensation","title-short":"Adaptation in Dyadic Interaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2885.1993.tb00076.x","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"casasIntermediatedRealityFramework2019","abstract":"We introduce Intermediated Reality (IR), a framework for intermediated communication enabling collaboration through remote possession of entities (e.g. toys) that come to life in mobile Mediated Reality (MR). As part of a two-way conversation demonstration, each person communicates through a toy figurine that is remotely located in front of the other participant. Each person's face is tracked through the front camera of their mobile devices and the tracking pose information is transmitted to the remote participant's device along with the synchronized captured voice audio, allowing a turn-based interactive avatar chat session, which we have called ToyMeet. By altering the camera video feed with a reconstructed appearance of the object in a deformed pose, we perform the illusion of movement in real-world objects to realize collaborative tele-present augmented reality (AR). In this turn based interaction, each participant first sees their own captured puppetry message locally with their device's front facing camera. Next, they receive a view of their counterpart's captured response locally (in AR) with seamless visual deformation of their local 3D toy seen through their device's rear facing camera. We detail optimization of the animation transmission and switching between devices with minimized latency for coherent smooth chat interaction. An evaluation of rendering performance and system latency is included. As an additional demonstration of our framework, we generate facial animation frames for 3D printed stop motion in collaborative mixed reality. This allows a reduction in printing costs since the in-between frames of key poses can be generated digitally with shared remote review.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Casas","given":"Llogari"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Kenny"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"choiCanYouFeel2016","abstract":"Since a telepresence system is a system intended to be used in interpersonal communication, conveying the presence of a remote sender is an important issue. Robotic telepresence system is a newer variant of a telepresence system. Even though robot characteristics of having physical embodiment could be effective on building presence of itself, this could yield distortion of presence of a remote sender in telepresence. Thus, in order to determine effective methods of increasing sender presence during telecommunication, we perform a two within-participants experiment, considering the effects of the embodiment levels, by comparing a weakly-embodied telepresence system, a tablet and a strongly-embodied telepresence system, a telepresence robot (number of participants, N = 48). In this study, the participants engage in conversations with a remote sender either through a tablet or a telepresence robot. The results show that participants have a lesser sense of sender presence for a strongly-embodied telepresence system compared to the weakly-embodied telepresence system. On the other hand, participants perceived more presence of a telepresence system toward a strongly-embodied telepresence system than a weakly-embodied telepresence system. The implications of these findings are the weakly-embodied telepresence systems would be effectively used in settings where emotional connection is a priority. In addition, incorporating sensory modalities should be considered for neutralizing the negative effects of strong embodiment on presence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Jung Ju"},{"family":"Kwak","given":"Sonya S."}],"container-title":"2016 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","DOI":"10.1109/ROMAN.2016.7745180","event":"2016 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-5090-3929-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"language":"en","page":"606-611","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Can you feel me?: How embodiment levels of telepresence systems affect presence","title-short":"Can you feel me?","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7745180/"},

Even though certain characteristics of robots such as identity could be eﬀective at generating a sense of presence, this risks yielding a distortion of presence in the remote sender. Thus, in order to ﬁnd eﬀective ways to increase presence, we executed an experiment comparing a telepresence robot with high identity and a telepresence robot with low identity. The 60 participants in this study engaged in a video call with a remote sender using either a telepresence robot with high identity or a telepresence robot with low identity. The results showed that participants felt more remote sender presence when interacting with the telepresence robot with low identity than they did with the one with high identity. On the other hand, when a telepresence robot has high identity, participants felt more presence toward the robot than they did toward the one with low identity. In the second study (N = 72), participants experienced two types of telepresence robots (identity level: a telepresence robot with high identity vs. a telepresence robot with low identity) with two types of remote senders (number of remote senders: single remote sender vs. multiple remote senders). The identity level of the robot and the number of remote senders aﬀected the presence of the remote sender, telepresence, and the presence of the robot.

  {"id":"chouliarakiImproperDistanceCritical2011","abstract":"Silverstone’s ‘proper distance’ is one of the most original and productive conceptualizations of a fundamental problem in the ethics of mediation: the humanization of vulnerable others. This is because ‘proper distance’ is not only a normative but also, importantly, an analytical concept. Whereas in its normative dimension, proper distance refers to the degree of proximity required for mediated relationships of care and responsibility to develop, in its analytical dimension, the metaphorical vocabulary of space becomes an important resource in evaluating how mediation produces ‘humanity’ through the positioning of mediated others along the axis of proximity–distance. My application of this analytical vocabulary to the mediation of humanitarianism enables me to create a typology of paradigms of solidarity, namely ‘pity’, ‘irony’ and ‘agonism’, highlighting the different ways in which their particular articulations of proximity–distance produce distinct conceptions of ‘humanity’ and, therefore, distinct proposals for solidarity towards vulnerable others. Focusing, specifically, on the critique of an emerging paradigm of solidarity as irony, I argue that, even though it appears as a promising response to pity and its misleading spatiality of universal proximity, irony celebrates consumerism as a reflexive distance-from-the self and is, therefore, unable to put forward a morally acceptable proposal of solidarity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Chouliaraki","given":"Lilie"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367877911403247","ISSN":"1367-8779, 1460-356X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"language":"en","page":"363-381","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘Improper distance’: Towards a critical account of solidarity as irony","title-short":"‘Improper distance’","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1367877911403247","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"christContextualEffectPositive2014","abstract":"We assessed evidence for a contextual effect of positive intergroup contact, whereby the effect of intergroup contact between social contexts (the between-level effect) on outgroup prejudice is greater than the effect of individual-level contact within contexts (the within-level effect). Across seven large-scale surveys (five cross-sectional and two longitudinal), using multilevel analyses, we found a reliable contextual effect. This effect was found in multiple countries, operationalizing context at multiple levels (regions, districts, and neighborhoods), and with and without controlling for a range of demographic and context variables. In four studies (three cross-sectional and one longitudinal) we showed that the association between context-level contact and prejudice was largely mediated by more tolerant norms. In social contexts where positive contact with outgroups was more commonplace, norms supported such positive interactions between members of different groups. Thus, positive contact reduces prejudice on a macrolevel, whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their social context, not merely on a microscale, via individuals’ direct experience of positive contact with outgroup members. These findings reinforce the view that contact has a significant role to play in prejudice reduction, and has great policy potential as a means to improve intergroup relations, because it can simultaneously impact large numbers of people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Christ","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Lolliot","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Swart","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Stolle","given":"Dietlind"},{"family":"Tausch","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Ramiah","given":"Ananthi Al"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Vertovec","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Hewstone","given":"Miles"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1320901111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,18]]},"language":"en","page":"3996-4000","PMID":"24591627","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www-pnas-org.libproxy.aalto.fi","title":"Contextual effect of positive intergroup contact on outgroup prejudice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/11/3996","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"cohenLanguageConflictResolution2001","abstract":"World leaders and diplomats conduct much international negotiation and conflict resolution today in English, which has become the modern global interlanguage. English speakers tend to assume that English transcends culture, perfectly capturing objective features of the external world. Comparison of the conflict resolution vocabularies of English, Arabic, and Hebrew demonstrates that themodel of conflict resolution implicit in English terminology is merely one possible version. The three languages vary significantly in their built-in assumptions about the nature of conflict, objectives of conflict resolution, and anticipation of what the termination of conflict entails. Such conceptual antinomies may hinder conflict resolution by impeding communication and frustrating the synchronization of negotiating moves. Nonnative speakers tend to speak in English but think in the mother tongue. Moreover, frontal negotiation is simply the point of contact among delegations whose consultation, decision making, drafting, and political processes are conducted in the native language. Israeli-Syrian negotiations since 1991 exemplify some dissonant expectations about conflict resolution across Hebrew and Arabic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Raymond"}],"container-title":"International Studies Review","DOI":"10.1111/1521-9488.00224","ISSN":"1468-2486","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1521-9488.00224","page":"25-51","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Language and Conflict Resolution: The Limits of English","title-short":"Language and Conflict Resolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1521-9488.00224","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"coyleBioinspiredSoftRobotics2018","abstract":"Animals exploit the deformability of soft structures to move efficiently in complex natural environments. These soft structures are inherently compliant and enable large strains in components not typically found in robotics. Such capabilities have inspired robotic engineers to incorporate soft technologies into their designs. One goal in soft robotics is to endow robots with new, bioinspired features that permit morphologically adaptive interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review three key elements of bioinspired soft robots from a mechanics vantage point, namely, materials selection, actuation, and design. Soft materials are necessary for safe interaction and overall actuation of bioinspired robots. The intrinsic properties of materials in soft robots allow for an ‘‘embodied intelligence’’ that can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity in ways not possible with rigidbodied robots Finally, soft robotics can be combined with tissue engineering and synthetic biology to create bio-hybrid systems with unique sensing, dynamic response, and mobility. Bioinspired soft robots have the ability to also expedite the evolution of co-robots that can safely interact with humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Coyle","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Majidi","given":"Carmel"},{"family":"LeDuc","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Hsia","given":"K.

The authors track recent trends in contact theory to the emergence of extended, or indirect, forms of contact. These advances lead to an intriguing proposition: that simply imagining intergroup interactions can produce more positive perceptions of outgroups. The authors discuss empirical research supporting the imagined contact proposition and ﬁnd it to be an approach that is at once deceptively simple and remarkably effective. Encouraging people to mentally simulate a positive intergroup encounter leads to improved outgroup attitudes and reduced stereotyping. It curtails intergroup anxiety and extends the attribution of perceivers’ positive traits to others. The authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of imagined contact compared to conventional strategies, outline an agenda for future research, and discuss applications for policymakers and educators in their efforts to encourage more positive intergroup relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Crisp","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Turner","given":"Rhiannon N."}],"container-title":"American Psychologist","container-title-short":"American Psychologist","DOI":"10.1037/a0014718","ISSN":"1935-990X, 0003-066X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","page":"231-240","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Can imagined interactions produce positive perceptions?: Reducing prejudice through simulated social contact.","title-short":"Can imagined interactions produce positive perceptions?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0014718","volume":"64"},

Such indicators can be recognized with a substantial level of agreement by different observers, and can be used to judge both amount and kind of creativity.

Autistic children have difficulties in social interaction, communication and fantasy and imagination. As part of the project we run trials where autistic children are playing with a small, non-humanoid mobile robot that can engage children in simple interaction games. In our project we focus on the behavioural, rather than the affective level of robots used in therapy, cf. [12]. In this paper we first discuss in more detail varieties of interactions where one child, or two children simultaneously, play with a robot. We then outline a new research direction in the project which studies how a mobile robot can adapt t o individual children. Quantitative examples of activity levels in child-robot interactions are included.

Two experiments were conducted using the “minimal group paradigm” to explore whether social identity theory inﬂuences trust formation and impressions of a robot. In Experiment 1, participants were allocated to either a “robot” or “computer” group, and then they played a cooperative visual tracking game with an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot as a partner. We hypothesised participants in the “robot group” would demonstrate intergroup bias by sitting closer to the robot (proxemics) and trusting the robot’s suggested answers more frequently than their “computer group” counterparts. Experiment 2 used an almost identical procedure with a different set of participants; however, all participants were assigned to the “robot group” and thee different levels of anthropomorphic robot movement were manipulated. Our results suggest that intergroup bias and humanlike movement can signiﬁcantly affect human-robot approach behaviour. Signiﬁcant effects were found for trusting the robot’s suggested answers with respect to task difﬁculty, but not for group membership or robot movement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Deligianis","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Stanton","given":"Christopher John"},{"family":"McGarty","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Catherine J."}],"container-title":"Journal of Human-Robot Interaction","DOI":"10.5898/JHRI.6.3.Deligianis","ISSN":"2163-0364","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,20]]},"language":"en","page":"4","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Impact of Intergroup Bias on Trust and Approach Behaviour Towards a Humanoid Robot","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://humanrobotinteraction.org/journal/index.php/HRI/article/view/250","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"feldmanMaternalPretermSkintoSkinContact2014","abstract":"Background: Maternal–newborn contact enhances organization of the infant’s physiological systems, including stress reactivity, autonomic functioning, and sleep patterns, and supports maturation of the prefrontal cortex and its ensuing effects on cognitive and behavioral control. Premature birth disrupts brain development and is associated with maternal separation and disturbances of contactsensitive systems. However, it is unknown whether the provision of maternal–preterm contact can improve long-term functioning of these systems.\nMethods: We used the Kangaroo Care (KC) intervention and provided maternal–newborn skin-to-skin contact to 73 premature infants for 14 consecutive days compared with 73 case-matched control subjects receiving standard incubator care. Children were then followed seven times across the ﬁrst decade of life and multiple physiologic, cognitive, parental mental health, and mother–child relational measures were assessed.\nResults: KC increased autonomic functioning (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and maternal attachment behavior in the postpartum period, reduced maternal anxiety, and enhanced child cognitive development and executive functions from 6 months to 10 years. By 10 years of age, children receiving KC showed attenuated stress response, improved RSA, organized sleep, and better cognitive control. RSA and maternal behavior were dynamically interrelated over time, leading to improved physiology, executive functions, and mother–child reciprocity at 10 years.\nConclusions: These ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to demonstrate long-term effects of early touch-based intervention on children’s physiologic organization and behavioral control and have salient implications for the care practices of premature infants. Results demonstrate the dynamic cascades of child physiological regulation and parental provisions in shaping developmental outcome and may inform the construction of more targeted early interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Feldman","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Rosenthal","given":"Zehava"},{"family":"Eidelman","given":"Arthur I."}],"container-title":"Biological Psychiatry","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.08.012","ISSN":"00063223","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1]]},"language":"en","page":"56-64","source":"Crossref","title":"Maternal-Preterm Skin-to-Skin Contact Enhances Child Physiologic Organization and Cognitive Control Across the First 10 Years of Life","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322313007646","volume":"75"},

  {"id":"fenwickMattersLearningEducation2015","abstract":"In this chapter we outline a “sociomaterial” configuration that has been circulating in the broader social sciences with useful potential for understanding dynamics of learning, pedagogy, curriculum, policy, and so forth. This approach seeks to examine critically how the social and material not only are entangled in what some call “assemblages” of the human and nonhuman, but also constitute the practices and knowings that comprise education. The chapter focuses in particular on methodologies for researching professional learning and knowing as sociomaterial practice. We draw examples from three doctoral studies-in-progress of learning in different settings: engineers in project teams developing environmental technologies, artists learning to balance multiple activities of art, market and bureaucracy, and health-care workers learning to implement a new technology in a paediatric diabetes clinic. These examples illustrate the insights as well as the dilemmas in working with sociomaterial approaches to make visible the materialities of learning. One key contribution here is the first hand voices of new researchers experimenting with these approaches. The methods and theories are difficult to apply, and the stories here help to reveal the strategies that student researchers adopted to work through the challenges of sociomaterial approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenwick","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Doyle","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Michael","given":"Maureen"},{"family":"Scoles","given":"Jennifer"}],"container-title":"MultiPluriTrans in Educational Ethnography","DOI":"10.14361/9783839427729-007","editor":[{"family":"Bollig","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Honig","given":"Michael-Sebastian"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Seele","given":"Claudia"}],"ISBN":"978-3-8376-2772-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"141-162","publisher":"transcript Verlag","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Matters of Learning and Education: Sociomaterial Approaches in Ethnographic Research","title-short":"Matters of Learning and Education","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.14361/9783839427729-007/html"},
  {"id":"fenwickSociomaterialityMedicalPractice2014","abstract":"Context In current debates about professional practice and education, increasing emphasis is placed on understanding learning as a process of ongoing participation rather than one of acquiring knowledge and skills. However, although this socio-cultural view is important and useful, issues have emerged in studies of practice-based learning that point to certain oversights. Methods Three issues are described here: (i) the limited attention paid to the importance of materiality – objects, technologies, nature, etc. – in questions of learning; (ii) the human-centric view of practice that fails to note the relations among social and material forces, and (iii) the conflicts between ideals of evidence-based standardised models and the sociomaterial contingencies of clinical practice. Discussion It is argued here that a socio-material approach to practice and learning offers important insights for medical education. This view is in line with a growing field of research in the materiality of everyday life, which embraces wide-ranging families of theory that can be only briefly mentioned in this short paper. The main premise they share is that social and material forces, culture, nature and technology, are enmeshed in everyday practice. Objects and humans act upon one another in ways that mutually transform their characteristics and activity. Examples from research in medical practice show how materials actively influence clinical practice, how learning itself is a material matter, how protocols are in fact temporary sociomaterial achievements, and how practices form unique and sometimes conflicting sociomaterial worlds, with diverse diagnostic and treatment approaches for the same thing. Conclusions This discussion concludes with implications for learning in practice. What is required is a shift from an emphasis on acquiring knowledge to participating more wisely in particular situations. This focus is on learning how to attune to minor material fluctuations and surprises, how to track one's own and others’ effects on ‘intra-actions’ and emerging effects, and how to improvise solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenwick","given":"Tara"}],"container-title":"Medical Education","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.12295","ISSN":"1365-2923","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/medu.12295","page":"44-52","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Sociomateriality in medical practice and learning: attuning to what matters","title-short":"Sociomateriality in medical practice and learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/medu.12295","volume":"48"},

A meta-analysis (N = 32) examined the model of social influence in virtual environments (Blascovich, 2002) and investigated whether agents and avatars in virtual environments elicit different levels of social influence. Results indicated that perceived avatars produced stronger responses than perceived agents. Level of immersion (desktop vs. fully immersive), dependent variable type (subjective vs. objective), task type (competitive vs. cooperative vs. neutral), and actual control of the representation (human vs. computer) were examined as moderators. An interaction effect revealed that studies conducted on a desktop that used objective measures showed a stronger effect for agency than those that were conducted on a desktop but used subjective measures. Competitive and cooperative tasks showed greater agency effects than neutral tasks. Studies in which both conditions were actually human controlled showed greater agency effects than studies in which both conditions were actually computer controlled.

It consists of a very complex mechanical structure that enables the hand to adapt and efficiently handle objects of various shapes, weights and textures. Today's prosthetic devices, struggling to provide similar functions, become overly complex and expensive. They are composed of multiple, precise parts, including miniaturised actuators and sensors as well as complex control, to satisfy the manipulation tasks required. In this paper we propose a soft pneumatic hand that adapts passively to the handled object due to its mechanical compliance. It is pressure driven and enables individual fingers to be controlled independently for dexterity or in groups when a synergistic finger movement is needed. The hand has a truly anatomical shape, is easy to replace and cheap in production. The design can be easily adjusted in terms of shape and size in order to fit each individual user. The paper presents the design, manufacturing technology, current control system and preliminary tests of the hand's capabilities.","author":[{"family":"Fras","given":"J."},{"family":"Althoefer","given":"K."}],"container-title":"2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2018.8593666","event":"2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)","ISSN":"2153-0866","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"page":"1-6","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Soft Biomimetic Prosthetic Hand: Design, Manufacturing and Preliminary Examination","title-short":"Soft Biomimetic Prosthetic Hand","type":"paper-conference"},

Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Frauenberger","given":"Christopher"}],"container-title":"ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

From this perspective, several features specified by the contact hypothesis (e.g. co-operative interaction) facilitate more harmonious intergroup interactions, at least in part, because they contribute to the development of a common ingroup identity.

As a result of a large fiber peripheral neuropathy, the patient has lost the major functional aspects of his body schema, and thereby the possibility of normally unattended movement. To maintain control of posture and movement, he is forced to compensate for that loss by depending on the perceptual system of a body image that is modified in important respects.

  {"id":"gallagherPhilosophicalConceptionsSelf2000","abstract":"Several recently developed philosophical approaches to the self promise to enhance the exchange of ideas between the philosophy of the mind and the other cognitive sciences. This review examines two important concepts of self: the 'minimal self', a self devoid of temporal extension, and the 'narrative self', which involves personal identity and continuity across time. The notion of a minimal self is first clarified by drawing a distinction between the sense of self-agency and the sense of self-ownership for actions. This distinction is then explored within the neurological domain with specific reference to schizophrenia, in which the sense of self-agency may be disrupted. The convergence between the philosophical debate and empirical study is extended in a discussion of more primitive aspects of self and how these relate to neonatal experience and robotics. The second concept of self, the narrative self, is discussed in the light of Gazzaniga's left-hemisphere 'interpreter' and episodic memory. Extensions of the idea of a narrative self that are consistent with neurological models are then considered. The review illustrates how the philosophical approach can inform cognitive science and suggests that a two-way collaboration may lead to a more fully developed account of the self.","author":[{"family":"Gallagher","given":"S"}],"container-title":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","container-title-short":"Trends Cogn.

These guidelines typically involve multi-step molding of composite materials (elastomers, paper, fiber, etc.) along with specially designed geometry. In this paper we present the design and fabrication of a robust, fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator where its bend radius and bending axis can be mechanically-programed with a flexible, selectively-placed conformal covering that acts to mechanically constrain motion. Several soft actuators were fabricated and their displacement and force capabilities were measured experimentally and compared to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Finally, a prototype two-digit end-effector was designed and programmed with the conformal covering to shape match a rectangular object. We demonstrated improved gripping force compared to a pure bending actuator. We envision this approach enabling rapid customization of soft actuator function for grasping applications where the geometry of the task is known a priori.","author":[{"family":"Galloway","given":"K.

Our main focus concerns the similarity between users and avatars, a factor known as truthfulness. Our experiment requires the participants to control three avatars using a third-person perspective: a robot, a suit and their virtual doppelganger (virtual representation of the self). In order to analyze users’ reactions and strategies, each task of the scenario of the virtual reality application can potentially affect the integrity of their characters. Our results revealed that ownership, one of the three factors of the sense of embodiment, is higher for the participants controlling their self-representation than with abstract representations. Furthermore, avatar visual ﬁdelity seems to affect users’ subjective experience, half of the panel reported having different behavior depending on the controlled character. Abstract representations allow the users to adopt more risky behaviors, while self-representations maintain a connection with the real world and encourage users to preserve the integrity of their avatar.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorisse","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Christmann","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Houzangbe","given":"Samory"},{"family":"Richir","given":"Simon"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"grossmanMindfulnessbasedStressReduction2004","abstract":"Objective\nMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR.\nMethods\nSixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis.\nResults\nOverall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P<.0001) with homogeneity of distribution.\nConclusion\nAlthough derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.","author":[{"family":"Grossman","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Niemann","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Walach","given":"Harald"}],"container-title":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0022-3999(03)00573-7","ISSN":"0022-3999","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,7,1]]},"page":"35-43","title":"Mindfulness-based stress reduction and health benefits: A meta-analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399903005737","volume":"57"},

While immersed in a virtual environment, participants listened to a persuasive communication from a digital representation of another student. The latter was actually an embodied agent (a computer-controlled digital representation of a human). Study 1 examined the extent to which gender of the virtual human, participant gender, and the agent's behavior affected attitude change. Results revealed gender-based ingroup favoritism in the form of greater attitude change for same gender virtual humans. Study 2 examined behavioral realism and agency beliefs; that is, whether participants believed the other to be an agent or an avatar (an online representation of an actual person). Results supported Blascovich and colleague's model of social influence within immersive virtual environments. Specifically, the prediction that virtual humans high in behavioral realism would be more influential than those low in behavioral realism was supported, but this effect was moderated by the gender of the virtual human and the research participant.

In both Study 1, conducted on a random sample of Israeli Jews (N = 103), and Study 2, conducted on a nationally diverse sample of Israeli Jews (N = 670), we experimentally test the effect of a unique approach to humanizing the outgroup based on empathy. Instead of requiring individuals to express empathy for outgroup suffering they might have caused, this approach requires an expression of empathy for suffering unrelated to the conﬂict between the groups.

The specific point of contact for the examination is the avatar.  What is at issue here is not the complicated structures and articulations of avatar identity but the assumed ‘real thing’ that is said to be its ultimate cause and referent.

A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes.\nResults: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r– = +0.26,with an experimental effect size of d– = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role.\nConclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated.

  {"id":"harmanAgentialSpeculativeRealism2016","abstract":"In the history of philosophy, \"realism\" usually refers to the view that a world exists independently of the human mind. This is not the case for the \"agential realism\" of Karen Barad, one of whose features is the view that entities emerge from their interactions rather than pre-existing them. This aspect of Barad's thought puts her at odds with the more traditional concept of realism found among the speculative realists. Yet Barad also rejects Descartes old taxonomical view that there must be two different kinds of entity: thought and dead matter. In abolishing this distinction, Barad is an ally of object-oriented philosophy even while opposing other forms of speculative realism. The second half of the essay criticizes Barad for conflating two entirely different senses of the word \"atomism,\" leading to difficult consequences for her philosophy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Harman","given":"Graham"}],"container-title":"Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge","container-title-short":"Rhizomes","DOI":"10.20415/rhiz/030.e10","ISSN":"15559998","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"1-1","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Agential and Speculative Realism: Remarks on Barad's Ontology","title-short":"Agential and Speculative Realism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.rhizomes.net/issue30/harman.html"},
  {"id":"harwoodContactSpaceNovel2010","abstract":"This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member.These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Harwood","given":"Jake"}],"container-title":"Journal of Language and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Language and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1177/0261927X09359520","ISSN":"0261-927X, 1552-6526","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,6]]},"language":"en","page":"147-177","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research","title-short":"The Contact Space","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0261927X09359520","volume":"29"},

A virtual human representing an outgroup member (a Palestinian) interacted with 60 Jewish Israeli participants in an experimental study. We manipulated postural mimicry by the virtual interaction partner during a conversation about a sensitive conﬂict issue. Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants’ feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup. The use of virtual–human interactions in obtaining this effect reveals the still widely unexplored potential of technology-enhanced conﬂict resolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasler","given":"Béatrice S."},{"family":"Hirschberger","given":"Gilad"},{"family":"Shani-Sherman","given":"Tal"},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Doron A."}],"container-title":"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","container-title-short":"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","DOI":"10.1089/cyber.2014.0213","ISSN":"2152-2715, 2152-2723","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12]]},"language":"en","page":"766-771","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Virtual Peacemakers: Mimicry Increases Empathy in Simulated Contact with Virtual Outgroup Members","title-short":"Virtual Peacemakers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2014.0213","volume":"17"},

Given that immersive virtual reality (VR) can simulate various points of view (POV), we examined whether it can lead to beneficial outcomes by promoting outgroup perspective-taking, even in armed conflicts. In two studies, Jewish-Israelis watched a 360° VR scene depicting an Israeli-Palestinian confrontation from different POVs–outgroup’s, ingroup’s while imagining outgroup perspective or ingroup’s without imagined perspective-taking. Participants immersed in the outgroup’s POV, but not those who imagined the outgroup’s perspective, perceived the Palestinians more positively than those immersed in the ingroup’s POV. Moreover, participants in the outgroup’s POV perceived the Palestinian population in general more favorably and judged a real-life ingroup transgression more strictly than those in the ingroup’s POV, even five months after VR intervention. Results suggest that VR can promote conflict resolution by enabling effective perspective-taking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasson","given":"Yossi"},{"family":"Schori-Eyal","given":"Noa"},{"family":"Landau","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hasler","given":"Béatrice S."},{"family":"Levy","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Doron"},{"family":"Halperin","given":"Eran"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0222342","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e0222342","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The enemy’s gaze: Immersive virtual environments enhance peace promoting attitudes and emotions in violent intergroup conflicts","title-short":"The enemy’s gaze","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222342","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"herreraBuildingLongtermEmpathy2018","abstract":"Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the “ultimate empathy machine” since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Herrera","given":"Fernanda"},{"family":"Bailenson","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Weisz","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Ogle","given":"Elise"},{"family":"Zaki","given":"Jamil"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0204494","editor":[{"family":"Bastian","given":"Brock"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,17]]},"language":"en","page":"e0204494","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Building long-term empathy: A large-scale comparison of traditional and virtual reality perspective-taking","title-short":"Building long-term empathy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204494","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"hesmondhalghCreativeWorkEmotional2008","abstract":"In keeping with the focus of this special section, we concentrate initially on some of the problems of autonomist Marxist concepts such as ‘immaterial labour’, ‘affective labour’ and ‘precarity’ for understanding work in the cultural industries. We then brieﬂy review some relevant media theory (John Thompson’s notion of mediated quasi-interaction) and some key recent sociological research on cultural labour (especially work by Andrew Ross and Laura Grindstaff, the latter drawing on Hochschild’s concept of emotional labour), which we believe may be more useful than autonomist concepts in developing empirically informed critique. The main body of the article then consists of an ethnographic account of working on one particular television programme, an account that aims to build on these theoretical debates. We analyse how the power to provide exposure or not to individuals in the talent show genre in contemporary television (a feature that derives from the symbolic power of producers to make texts that are then circulated to massive numbers of people) and disputes between commissioners and independent producers about how best to go about doing so (an organizational issue) are registered in the form of stress, anxiety and sometimes poor working relations among project teams of young television researchers (a matter of working conditions and experiences). We especially focus on how additional pressures are borne by these workers because of the requirements to undertake emotional labour, involving the handling of strong emotions on the part of talent show contributors, and to maintain good working relations in short-term project work, requirements generated by the need to ensure future employment. Ultimately, then, we support the view that creative work is ‘precarious’ – but we go beyond the generalizations involved in concepts such as immaterial labour and affective labour to show the speciﬁc ways in which precariousness is registered and negotiated in the lives of young workers in one industry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hesmondhalgh","given":"David"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Sarah"}],"container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276408097798","ISSN":"0263-2764, 1460-3616","issue":"7-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12]]},"language":"en","page":"97-118","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Creative Work and Emotional Labour in the Television Industry","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0263276408097798","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"hiramitsuExperimentalEvaluationTextile2019","abstract":"Pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles have some advantages. Especially, the ﬂexibility of artiﬁcial muscles contributes to compose novel mechanisms. The ﬂexibility of pneumatic artiﬁcial muscles releases us from the spatially strict design that is necessary for rigid mechanical mechanisms. It could actualize compact mechanisms consisting of fewer components. The thin McKibben muscles are more ﬂexible than conventional McKibben muscles. Authors succeeded in manufacturing novel soft mechanisms that are composed of only woven artiﬁcial muscles and strings. We called this mechanism active textile. The structure is uniformed with woven artiﬁcial muscles; nevertheless, the forms and movements of mechanisms are diverse. We aim to establish a design method for these active textiles. Thus, we should know how the expansion of muscles affects the behavior of mechanisms. We reported that deformations of active textiles are changed by woven structures. In addition to that, wefts’ characteristics such as cross-sectional shape, bending stiffness and elasticity determine the characteristic of a textile. Deformations of active textiles are caused by the contraction and the expansion of thin McKibben muscles. In this paper, authors focus the contraction in the wefts direction of active textile that is caused by the expansion of thin McKibben muscles as warps. We fabricated three different active textiles that made of thin McKibben muscle and three different strings. We observed experimentally the contraction behavior in the weft direction of active textiles: the contraction characteristics the relationship between applied pressure and contraction ratio and the relationship between applied pressure and contraction force. As result, the contraction characteristics of active textiles are changed by using different strings as wefts. Maximum contraction force is caused by using thin strings, and the hysteresis of the active textile that made of elastic strings is small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hiramitsu","given":"Tatsuhiro"},{"family":"Suzumori","given":"Koichi"},{"family":"Nabae","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Endo","given":"Gen"}],"container-title":"2019 2nd IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)","DOI":"10.1109/ROBOSOFT.2019.8722802","event":"2019 2nd IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)","event-place":"Seoul, Korea (South)","ISBN":"978-1-5386-9260-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Seoul, Korea (South)","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Experimental Evaluation of Textile Mechanisms Made of Artificial Muscles","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8722802/"},

In the present investigation, interpersonal-disgust sensitivity (e.g., not wanting to wear clean used clothes or to sit on a warm seat vacated by a stranger) in particular predicted negative attitudes toward immigrants, foreigners, and socially deviant groups, even after controlling for concerns with contracting disease. The mechanisms underlying the link between interpersonal disgust and attitudes toward immigrants were explored using a path model. As predicted, the effect of interpersonaldisgust sensitivity on group attitudes was indirect, mediated by ideological orientations (social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism) and dehumanizing perceptions of the out-group. The effects of social dominance orientation on group attitudes were both direct and indirect, via dehumanization. These results establish a link between disgust sensitivity and prejudice that is not accounted for by fear of infection, but rather is mediated by ideological orientations and dehumanizing group representations. Implications for understanding and reducing prejudice are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hodson","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Costello","given":"Kimberly"}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01962.x","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,8]]},"language":"en","page":"691-698","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interpersonal Disgust, Ideological Orientations, and Dehumanization as Predictors of Intergroup Attitudes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01962.x","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"hoffmanDesignEvaluationPeripheral2015","abstract":"We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a peripheral empathy-evoking robotic conversation companion, Kip1. The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote nonaggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to-human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.","author":[{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Zuckerman","given":"Oren"},{"family":"Hirschberger","given":"Gilad"},{"family":"Luria","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Shani-Sherman","given":"Tal"}],"container-title":"2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","event":"2015 10th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)","ISSN":"2167-2121","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3]]},"page":"3-10","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Design and Evaluation of a Peripheral Robotic Conversation Companion","type":"paper-conference"},

If human interference is detected behind the machine, Robot-Mediated Communication commences, which basically follows CMC assumptions; if human interference remains undetected, Human-Robot Communication comes into play, holding the robot for an autonomous social actor. The more emotionally aroused a robot user is, the more likely they develop an affective relationship with what actually is a machine.

  {"id":"hultinBecomingSociomaterialResearcher2019","abstract":"What is the role of the researcher in a world that is continuously enacted and reconﬁgured in sociomaterial practices, a world in which subject and object, structure and agency, body and mind, knower and known, are assumed to be ontologically inseparable? In this article, I explore this question by drawing on my own experiences of reconsidering essentialist and representationalist assumptions, and becoming a sociomaterial researcher. My exploration draws on my experiences of conducting a qualitative longitudinal case study at the Swedish Migration Board. Speciﬁcally, I show what it can mean to ‘invite materiality’ into interviews, examine the conditions of possibility to become in certain ways by tracing the genealogy of practices, and engage with data relationally rather than categorically. By accounting for my experience of working through these practices, I aim to develop and articulate an understanding of what the ontological position underlying a sociomaterial approach implies for epistemology, and of how we can act (or, rather, intra-act) more creatively and responsibly as sociomaterial researchers. Moreover, I highlight diﬀerences in the kinds of knowledge that a sociomaterial approach grounded in relational and performative onto-epistemologies, as opposed to a socio-material approach, grounded in critical realism, produce about the unfolding of organizational practices—speciﬁcally, the practices unfolding in the reception area of the Swedish Migration Board. The paper contributes to the current debate on sociomaterial approaches, and in particular to the development of practices available to draw upon for researchers taking a sociomaterial approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hultin","given":"Lotta"}],"container-title":"Information and Organization","container-title-short":"Information and Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.infoandorg.2019.04.004","ISSN":"14717727","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"language":"en","page":"91-104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On becoming a sociomaterial researcher: Exploring epistemological practices grounded in a relational, performative ontology","title-short":"On becoming a sociomaterial researcher","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471772717302488","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"hultinDecenteredTranslationManagement2021","abstract":"Based on a study of Lean management practices at the Swedish Migration Board, we develop a novel theoretical understanding of the translation of management ideas. We show how translation, rather than being reduced to a network of human intentions and actions governing the transformation of organizational practices, can instead be understood as a historically contingent, situated flow of mundane everyday work practices through which social and material translators simultaneously become translated, conditioned to be and act in certain ways. We show how prior actor-centric accounts of translation of management ideas can be understood as performative consequences of a conceptual vocabulary inherited from Callon and Latour. Contrasting this, the non-actor-centric vocabulary of social anthropologist Tim Ingold allows us to background the intentional human actor and foreground the flow of mundane, situated practices. In adopting this vocabulary, we capture how the flow of practices conditions subjects and objects to become enacted as well as act, and develop an understanding of translation as occurring within, rather than distinct from, these practices. In essence, our novel view of translation emphasizes how management ideas are radically unstable, and subject to alteration through the flow of practices rather than as a result of deliberate implementation efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Hultin","given":"Lotta"},{"family":"Introna","given":"Lucas D"},{"family":"Mähring","given":"Magnus"}],"container-title":"Human Relations","container-title-short":"Human Relations","DOI":"10.1177/0018726719897967","ISSN":"0018-7267, 1741-282X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","page":"587-620","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The decentered translation of management ideas: Attending to the conditioning flow of everyday work practices","title-short":"The decentered translation of management ideas","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0018726719897967","volume":"74"},
  {"id":"huSelfbalancingControlManipulation2009","abstract":"This video shows a continuing work of the glove puppet robot presented before. The major improvement from the previous work is to mount the 9-DOF mechanism, which mimicking a glove puppet manipulation, on a two-wheel mobile platform. The platform provides agile movements of the robot but itself is an unstable system. Hence, a self-balancing controller is implemented by considering the motion as well as configuration variation of the upper body (the 9-DOF mechanism). The control law utilizes the principle of computed torque method with online identification of related parameters using various sensors including an accelerometer. The incline angle is obtained by fusing a gyroscope and a tilt sensor. Under the balancing control, the forward motion of the robot is achieved by giving a desired tilt angle profile. To minimize the footprint of electronics, the controller is implemented using an 8-bit single-chip microcontroller. Further, to enhance the interaction capability of the system, a simple gesture coding using dynamic time warping identification method with Markov model is implemented for the data glove to recognize the puppet gesture by human hand.","author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"J."},{"family":"Wang","given":"J."},{"family":"Sun","given":"G."}],"container-title":"2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","DOI":"10.1109/IROS.2009.5354197","event":"2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","ISSN":"2153-0866","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,10]]},"page":"424-425","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Self-balancing control and manipulation of a glove puppet robot on a two-wheel mobile platform","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"ihdeHomoFaberRevisited2018","abstract":"Humans, more than any other species, have been altering their paths of development by creating new material forms and by opening up to new possibilities of material engagement. That is, we become constituted through making and using technologies that shape our minds and extend our bodies. We make things which in turn make us. This ongoing dialectic has long been recognised from a deep-time perspective. It also seems natural in the present in view of the ways new materialities and digital ecologies increasingly envelop our everyday life and thinking. Still the basic idea that humans and things are co-constituted continues to challenge us, raising important questions about the place and meaning of materiality and technical change in human life and evolution. This paper bridging perspectives from postphenomenology and Material Engagement Theory (MET) is trying to attain better understanding about these matters. Our emphasis falls specifically on the human predisposition for technological embodiment and creativity. We re-approach the notion Homo faber in a way that, on the one hand, retains the power and value of this notion to signify the primacy of making or creative material engagement in human life and evolution and, on the other hand, reclaims the notion from any misleading connotations of human exceptionalism (other animals make and use tools). In particular, our use of the term Homo faber refers to the special place that this ability has in the evolution and development of our species. The difference that makes the difference is not just the fact that we make things. The difference that makes the difference is the recursive effect that the things that we make and our skills of making seem to have on human becoming. We argue that we are Homo faber not just because we make things but also because we are made by them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ihde","given":"Don"},{"family":"Malafouris","given":"Lambros"}],"container-title":"Philosophy & Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s13347-018-0321-7","ISSN":"2210-5433, 2210-5441","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,30]]},"language":"en","source":"Crossref","title":"Homo faber Revisited: Postphenomenology and Material Engagement Theory","title-short":"Homo faber Revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13347-018-0321-7"},

  {"id":"iliopoulosMaterialEngagementTheory2019","abstract":"Material Engagement Theory (MET) is currently driving a conceptual change in the archaeology of mind. Drawing upon the dictates of enactivism and active externalism, it specifically calls for a radical reconceptualization of mind and material culture. Unpersuaded by the common assumption that cognition is brain-bound, Malafouris argues in favour of a process ontology that situates thinking in action. In granting ontological primacy to material engagement, MET seeks to illuminate the emergence of human ways of thinking through the practical effects of the material world. Considering that this is a characteristic example of a pragmatic take on cognition, this contemporary theoretical platform appears to share a lot with pragmatism. As of late, scholars working at the intersection of philosophy, semiotics, and cognitive science have made important steps towards the rapprochement between pragmatism and externalism. Looking to contribute to this growing corpus of work, the present paper focuses on MET’s relation to the pragmatism of Peirce, Dewey, and Mead. Having elsewhere recognized the overlap and complementarity between Malafouris’ and Peirce’s theories in particular, I developed a pragmatic and enactive theory of cognitive semiotics that is suitably geared to trace the nature, emergence, and evolution of material signs. Therefore, besides noting some obvious historical connections, I hereby aim to establish (at least part of) the theoretical backdrop upon which this composite theory is supposed to function, while also exploring new potential avenues. Given that this cognitive semiotic framework can be seen as a pragmatic extension of Malafouris’ enactivist approach to archaeology, the current paper delves into MET’s theoretical underpinnings, seeking to complement its working hypotheses and concepts with philosophical notions and ideas advanced long ago. This synthesis ultimately concludes with a call for the reconceptualization of ‘representation’ as a heuristic concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Iliopoulos","given":"Antonis"}],"container-title":"Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences","DOI":"10.1007/s11097-018-9596-5","ISSN":"1568-7759, 1572-8676","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"39-63","source":"Crossref","title":"Material Engagement Theory and its philosophical ties to pragmatism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11097-018-9596-5","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"influsSocialNeuroscienceApproach2018","abstract":"The rapid increase in terror-related activities, shift of battlefield into civilian locations, and participation of youth in acts of violence underscore the need to find novel frameworks for youth interventions. Building on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and social neuroscience models we developed an eight-week dialogue group-intervention for youth growing up amidst intractable conflict. Eighty-eight Israeli-Jewish and Arab-Palestinian adolescents (16-18years) were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Before (T1) and after (T2) intervention, one-on-one conflict interaction with outgroup member were videotaped, oxytocin levels assayed, attitudes self-reported, and youth interviewed regarding national conflict. We tested the hypothesis that dialogue intervention would enhance empathic behavior and increase oxytocin levels following interaction with outgroup member. Intervention increased youth perspective-taking on national conflict. Oxytocin increased from T1 to T2 only for adolescents undergoing intervention who improved perspective taking in the process. Structural equation modelling charted three pathways to behavioral empathy toward outgroup member at T2; via endogenous oxytocin, empathic cognitions, and dialogue intervention; however, an alternative model without the intervention arm was non-significant. Our findings highlight the important role of empathy in programs for inter-group reconciliation and support evolutionary models on the precarious balance between the neurobiology of affiliation and the neurobiology of outgroup derogation.","author":[{"family":"Influs","given":"Moran"},{"family":"Pratt","given":"Maayan"},{"family":"Masalha","given":"Shafiq"},{"family":"Zagoory-Sharon","given":"Orna"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Ruth"}],"container-title":"Social Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Soc Neurosci","DOI":"10.1080/17470919.2018.1479983","ISSN":"1747-0927","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"1-12","PMID":"29799332","source":"PubMed","title":"A social neuroscience approach to conflict resolution: Dialogue intervention to Israeli and Palestinian youth impacts oxytocin and empathy","title-short":"A social neuroscience approach to conflict resolution","type":"article-journal"},

Anthropology and ethnography may have much to contribute to one another, but their aims and objectives are different. Ethnography is an end in itself; it is not a means to anthropological ends. Moreover, participant observation is an anthropological way of working, not a method of ethnographic data collection. To study anthropology is to study with people, not to make studies of them; such study is not so much ethnographic as educational. An anthropological education gives us the intellectual means to speculate on the conditions of human life in this world, without our having to pretend that our arguments are distillations of the practical wisdom of those among whom we have worked. Our job is to correspond with them, not to speak for them.

  {"id":"ioannouExperimentalComparisonDirect2018","abstract":"Indirect forms of intergroup contact, such as extended and vicarious contact, are thought to provide a promising alternative to direct contact, but very few studies have compared the effectiveness of these two types of contact to confirm this claim. Furthermore, Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, and Ropp (1997) postulated, but did not test, that the usefulness of extended (or vicarious) over direct contact lies in these forms of indirect contact being likely to elicit less anxiety and more group salience at the time of the interaction, both of which are beneficial for contact. The present paper reports two experiments comparing the effects of direct and vicarious contact on: (i) outgroup attitudes and anxiety for future contact both immediately after contact (posttest) as well as a week later (delayed posttest), and (ii) their elicited interaction-induced anxiety and group salience. Both studies were conducted in Cyprus, with Greek Cypriot participants and the Turkish Cypriot community as the outgroup. Results did not support Wright et al.’s postulations. They furthermore showed that direct contact had a relative advantage over vicarious contact in leading to more positive outgroup attitudes at posttest, but that attitudes reverted to pretest levels for both conditions at delayed posttest. Vicarious, unlike direct, contact, did, however, lead to a persistent reduction of anxiety for future contact, thus suggesting that the greatest utility of indirect forms of contact may lie in their emotionally preparing individuals for subsequent face-to-face interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ioannou","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Al Ramiah","given":"Ananthi"},{"family":"Hewstone","given":"Miles"}],"container-title":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jesp.2017.11.010","ISSN":"0022-1031","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"393-403","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An experimental comparison of direct and indirect intergroup contact","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116307235","volume":"76"},

While schools of thought differ significantly in how they position themselves vis-à-vis the subjectivist-objectivist axis, few would deny that the delineation of the interpretive task must attend to the embodied character of human cognition. Taking such a broader framework as a starting point, I will tackle a specific aspect of this problematic by examining Foucault’s conception of subjectivity and truth as it relates to issues of epistemology, moral responsibility, and askēsis. As I will argue, Foucault’s “art of living” persuasively highlights the background or “unthought” aspects of hermeneutics. My particular approach will be to connect Foucault’s brand of virtue epistemology with a broadly post-Heideggerian conception of engaged agency, and in so doing spotlight some assumptions as to what “having truth” or “arriving at it” might mean in the context of hermeneutical practice and being.","author":[{"family":"JeronÄ","given":"Ante"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"The Truthful Self: Subjectivity, Truth, and Hermeneutics in Dialogue with Michel Foucault","type":"article-journal"},

We also ﬁnd that ﬂaming is associated with anger directed toward a negotiator's partner, which can occur when a negotiator perceives that the partner is being unfair. We ﬁnd further that anger totally mediates the relationships between ﬂaming and its antecedents.

Study Two examined the role of visual anonymity in encouraging self-disclosure during CMC. Visually anonymous participants disclosed significantly more information about themselves than non-visually anonymous participants. In Study Three, private and public self-awareness were independently manipulated, using video-conferencing cameras and accountability cues, to create a 2 × 2 design public self-awareness (high and low)×private self-awareness (high and low). It was found that heightened private self-awareness, when combined with reduced public self-awareness, was associated with significantly higher levels of spontaneous self-disclosure during computer-mediated communication.

Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U.S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects.

  {"id":"jungUsingRobotsModerate2015","abstract":"We explore whether robots can positively influence conflict dynamics by repairing interpersonal violations that occur during a team-based problem-solving task. In a 2 (negative trigger: task- directed vs. personal attack) x 2 (repair: yes vs. no) between- subjects experiment (N = 57 teams, 114 participants), we studied the effect of a robot intervention on affect, perceptions of conflict, perceptions of team members' contributions, and team performance during a problem-solving task. Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot's repair interventions increased the groups' awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups' tendency to suppress the conflict. These findings suggest that repair heightened awareness of a normative violation. Overall, our results provide support for the idea that robots can aid team functioning by regulating core team processes such as conflict.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Malte F."},{"family":"Martelaro","given":"Nikolas"},{"family":"Hinds","given":"Pamela J."}],"collection-title":"HRI '15","container-title":"Proceedings of the Tenth Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","DOI":"10.1145/2696454.2696460","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2883-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,2]]},"page":"229–236","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Using Robots to Moderate Team Conflict: The Case of Repairing Violations","title-short":"Using Robots to Moderate Team Conflict","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2696454.2696460"},
  {"id":"juttenColonizationThesisHabermas2011","abstract":"According to Habermas’ colonization thesis, reiﬁcation is a social pathology that arises when the communicative infrastructure of the lifeworld is ‘colonized’ by money and power. In this paper I argue that, thirty years after the publication of the Theory of Communicative Action, this thesis remains compelling. However, while Habermas offers a functionalist explanation of reiﬁcation, his normative criticism of it remains largely implicit: he never explains what is wrong with reiﬁcation from the perspective of the people whose social relations are reiﬁed. As a result, Habermas cannot explain why only some forms of colonization lead to reiﬁcation effects. In particular, he suggests that reiﬁcation effects result from the juridiﬁcation of communicatively structured domains of action but not from the commodiﬁcation of labour power. I criticize this argument and suggest that if the normative dimension of the colonization thesis is made explicit, a more nuanced explanation of reiﬁcation becomes possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jütten","given":"Timo"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Philosophical Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Philosophical Studies","DOI":"10.1080/09672559.2011.629672","ISSN":"0967-2559, 1466-4542","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"language":"en","page":"701-727","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Colonization Thesis: Habermas on Reification","title-short":"The Colonization Thesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09672559.2011.629672","volume":"19"},

In this work, we attempt to robotize the glove puppet (called X-puppet) along with three types of manipulation interface including a motion editor, a data glove and a motion capture system. The motion editor is a higher level puppet motion composer that creates and combines sequences of control in a timely fashion. The special designed data glove uses a minimum number of sensors to achieve puppet manipulation. It measures the gesture data and maps to the motion of X-puppet in real-time. The motion capture system can extract the puppetpsilas motion from the video and then control the X-puppet to simulate the action.

In particular, we redesign the generator normalization, revisit progressive growing, and regularize the generator to encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes to images. In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional beneﬁt that the generator becomes signiﬁcantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements.

  {"id":"kashianSelfdisclosureLikingComputermediated2017","abstract":"This research investigated the process by which self-disclosure leads to liking in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Research has shown that CMC inﬂuences the attributions that individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these attributions. However, little is known about the impact that attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that selfdisclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock’s (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for CMC's unique impact on the relationship between selfdisclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Kashian","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Jang","given":"Jeong-woo"},{"family":"Shin","given":"Soo Yun"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Walther","given":"Joseph B."}],"container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2017.01.041","ISSN":"07475632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6]]},"language":"en","page":"275-283","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Self-disclosure and liking in computer-mediated communication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563217300535","volume":"71"},

In physical spatial collaboration such as team dancing, theatrical performance, and team sport, one’s behavior should be in accord with the partner’s; the relative position in distance and in direction is critically important all the time even when moving. To realize remote physical spatial collaboration, achieving the shared recognition of positional relationship is one of the key issues. In this paper, we propose a setup between two remote sites where each collaborator immerses in the other remote site by a telepresence robot situated in the other site. The telepresence robot is a wheeled platform with a camera attached at man’s eye height. It moves in response to the remote user’s position and orientation and enables the user to get the first-person view video through a head-mounted display. By using two telepresence robots from both sites, both collaborators can recognize the partner being in front of him/her and can grasp the distance and the orientation of the partner in remote site. In the proposed setup, users can grasp the positional relationship as accurate and quick as the existing fixed views including the bird's-eye view.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Katayama","given":"Naoki"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"Tomoo"},{"family":"Shigeno","given":"Hiroshi"}],"container-title":"2018 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design ((CSCWD))","DOI":"10.1109/CSCWD.2018.8465391","event":"2018 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD)","event-place":"Nanjing","ISBN":"978-1-5386-1482-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5]]},"language":"en","page":"325-329","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Nanjing","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sharing the Positional Relationship with the Bidirectional Telepresence Robots","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8465391/"},

The multidimensional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one’s biological body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working deﬁnition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kilteni","given":"Konstantina"},{"family":"Groten","given":"Raphaela"},{"family":"Slater","given":"Mel"}],"container-title":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","container-title-short":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","DOI":"10.1162/PRES_a_00124","ISSN":"1054-7460, 1531-3263","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,11]]},"language":"en","page":"373-387","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Sense of Embodiment in Virtual Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/PRES_a_00124","volume":"21"},

This design principle may provide guidance for designing bioinspired, adaptive, and extreme shape-morphing systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Woongbae"},{"family":"Byun","given":"Junghwan"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jae-Kyeong"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Woo-Young"},{"family":"Jakobsen","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"Jakobsen","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dae-Young"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Kyu-Jin"}],"container-title":"Science Robotics","container-title-short":"Sci.

We conceptualize online contact as occurring through users’ comments online, an easy and accessible venue for intergroup encounters. We test two forms of online contact: encountering an outgroup member directly (direct online contact) or through an ingroup member (extended online contact) and their effects on outgroup attitudes, here various forms of threat and social distance. We also examine the emotional mechanisms through which these effects emerge. We rely on an online experiment (N ¼ 396) testing online contact with two distinct outgroups, an undocumented immigrant or a gay person. Compared to the control, direct online contact decreased perceived threat and social distance toward gays and lesbians, but not toward undocumented immigrants. Direct online contact improved attitudes toward both outgroups through positive and negative emotions, whereas extended online contact reduced negative emotions, improving attitudes towards undocumented immigrants. We discuss theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these ﬁndings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Nuri"},{"family":"Wojcieszak","given":"Magdalena"}],"container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.013","ISSN":"07475632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4]]},"language":"en","page":"63-72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intergroup contact through online comments: Effects of direct and extended contact on outgroup attitudes","title-short":"Intergroup contact through online comments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563217306507","volume":"81"},

In all these approaches, the body is viewed as a locus for experience and knowledge. If the body is a source of subjective knowledge, then it can also become an important means of creating ontological categories of self and society. The materiality of human representations within art traditions, then, can be interpreted as providing a means for contextualizing and aestheticizing the body in order to produce a symbolic and structural knowledge category.

Current industry approaches to avatars in social VR applications vary widely, and the (sometimes tacit) design knowledge acquired by those who created these platforms has much to offer research in HCI. In this paper, we describe current design practices, and reflect on the design approaches that characterize avatars and avatar systems in this emerging commercial sector. To investigate design approaches to avatar systems and their impact on communication and interaction with people within this medium, we interviewed industry experts associated with a range of platforms including Rec Room, AltspaceVR, High Fidelity, VRChat, Anyland, and Mozilla Hubs. In analyzing the ways that design choices shape embodied experience, we map design approaches to avatar systems in this evolving landscape and make preliminary claims about the impact of these varying design approaches.","author":[{"family":"Kolesnichenko","given":"Anya"},{"family":"McVeigh-Schultz","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Isbister","given":"Katherine"}],"container-title":"Virtual Reality","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Understanding Emerging Design Practices for Avatar Systems in the Commercial Social VR Ecology","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"korywestlundFlatVsExpressive2017","abstract":"Prior research with preschool children has established that dialogic or active book reading is an effective method for expanding young children’s vocabulary. In this exploratory study, we asked whether similar benefits are observed when a robot engages in dialogic reading with preschoolers. Given the established effectiveness of active reading, we also asked whether this effectiveness was critically dependent on the expressive characteristics of the robot. For approximately half the children, the robot’s active reading was expressive; the robot’s voice included a wide range of intonation and emotion (Expressive). For the remaining children, the robot read and conversed with a flat voice, which sounded similar to a classic text-to-speech engine and had little dynamic range (Flat). The robot's movements were kept constant across conditions. We performed a verification study using Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that the Expressive robot was viewed as significantly more expressive, more emotional, and less passive than the Flat robot. We invited 45 preschoolers with an average age of 5 years who were either English Language Learners (ELL), bilingual, or native English speakers to engage in the reading task with the robot. The robot narrated a story from a picture book, using active reading techniques and including a set of target vocabulary words in the narration. Children were post-tested on the vocabulary words and were also asked to retell the story to a puppet. A subset of 34 children performed a second story retelling 4-6 weeks later. Children reported liking and learning from the robot a similar amount in the Expressive and Flat conditions. However, as compared to children in the Flat condition, children in the Expressive condition were more concentrated and engaged as indexed by their facial expressions; they emulated the robot's story more in their story retells; and they told longer stories during their delayed retelling. Furthermore, children who responded to the robot’s active reading questions were more likely to correctly identify the target vocabulary words in the Expressive condition than in the Flat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that children may benefit more from the expressive robot than from the flat robot.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kory Westlund","given":"Jacqueline M."},{"family":"Jeong","given":"Sooyeon"},{"family":"Park","given":"Hae W."},{"family":"Ronfard","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Adhikari","given":"Aradhana"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Paul L."},{"family":"DeSteno","given":"David"},{"family":"Breazeal","given":"Cynthia L."}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Front.

For this purpose, we built Keepon, which is a small creature-like robot, and observed how autistic and typically-developing children (2–4 years old) interacted with it. Keepon was placed in their playrooms just as one of their toys, and tele-controlled by a human operator in a remote room; the children naturally and spontaneously showed various communicative actions to Keepon. From the longitudinal observations for more than two years (over 100 sessions of 3 hours) in a remedial institute and a preschool, we found that Keepon’s comprehensive appearance and predictable responses gave the children a playful and relaxed mood, in which they spontaneously engaged in dyadic interaction with Keepon, and also that the typically-developing children and some of the autistic children extended the interaction into triadic one, where Keepon worked as the pivot of interpersonal play with their caregivers. Each child showed a different style and a different unfolding of interaction over time, which tell us a “story” of his or her personality and developmental proﬁle, which is informative for the caregiver and the nursing staff to understand the child better, and is now being utilized for improving the remedial and educational services.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kozima","given":"H."},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"C."}],"container-title":"9th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control, 2006.","DOI":"10.1109/AMC.2006.1631756","event":"9th IEEE International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control, 2006.","event-place":"Istanbul, Turkey","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"768-773","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Istanbul, Turkey","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social robots for children: practice in communication-care","title-short":"Social robots for children","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1631756/"},

  {"id":"kteilyTheySeeUs2016","abstract":"Although the act of dehumanizing an outgroup is a pervasive and potent intergroup process that drives discrimination and conflict, no formal research has examined the consequences of being dehumanized by an outgroup—that is, “metadehumanization.” Across 10 studies (N ϭ 3,440) involving several real-world conflicts spanning 3 continents, we provide the first empirical evidence that metadehumanization (a) plays a central role in outgroup aggression that is (b) mediated by outgroup dehumanization, and (c) distinct from metaprejudice. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrate experimentally that Americans who learn that Arabs (Study 1a) or Muslims (Study 1b) blatantly dehumanize Americans are more likely to dehumanize that outgroup in return; by contrast, experimentally increasing outgroup dehumanization did not increase metadehumanization (Study 1c). Using correlational data, Study 2 documents indirect effects of metadehumanization on Americans’ support for aggressive policies toward Arabs (e.g., torture) via Arab dehumanization. In the context of Hungarians and ethnic minority Roma, Study 3 shows that the pathway for Hungarians from metadehumanization to aggression through outgroup dehumanization holds controlling for outgroup prejudice. Study 4 examines Israelis’ metaperceptions with respect to Palestinians, showing that: (a) feeling dehumanized (i.e., metadehumanization) is distinct from feeling disliked (i.e., metaprejudice), and (b) metadehumanization uniquely influences aggression through outgroup dehumanization, controlling for metaprejudice. Studies 5a and 5b explore Americans’ metaperceptions regarding ISIS and Iran. We document a dehumanization-specific pathway from metadehumanization to aggressive attitudes and behavior that is distinct from the path from metaprejudice through prejudice to aggression. In Study 6, American participants learning that Muslims humanize Americans (i.e., metahumanization) humanize Muslims in turn. Finally, Study 7 experimentally contrasts metadehumanization and metahumanization primes, and shows that resulting differences in outgroup dehumanization are mediated by (a) perceived identity threat, and (b) a general desire to reciprocate the outgroup’s perceptions of the ingroup. In summary, our research outlines how and why metadehumanization contributes to cycles of ongoing violence and animosity, providing direction for future research and policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kteily","given":"Nour"},{"family":"Hodson","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Bruneau","given":"Emile"}],"container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/pspa0000044","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"343-370","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"They see us as less than human: Metadehumanization predicts intergroup conflict via reciprocal dehumanization.","title-short":"They see us as less than human","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pspa0000044","volume":"110"},

Recent invented media resemble cute animals or imaginary creatures that quickly attract attention. However, such appearances could distort tele-communications because they are different from human beings. This paper studies the effect on the speaker’s personality that is transmitted through physical media by regarding appearances as a function that transmits the speaker’s information. Although communication media’s capability to transmit information reportedly inﬂuences conversations in many aspects, the effect of appearances remains unclear. To reveal the effect of appearance, we compared three appearances of communication media: stuffed-bear teleoperated robot, human-like teleoperated robot, and video chat. Our results show that communication media whose appearance greatly differs from that of the speaker distorts the personality perceived by interlocutors. This paper suggests that the design of the appearance of physical communication media needs to be carefully selected.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuwamura","given":"Kaiko"},{"family":"Minato","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Nishio","given":"Shuichi"},{"family":"Ishiguro","given":"Hiroshi"}],"container-title":"2012 IEEE RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","DOI":"10.1109/ROMAN.2012.6343730","event":"2012 RO-MAN: The 21st IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","event-place":"Paris, France","ISBN":"978-1-4673-4606-1 978-1-4673-4604-7 978-1-4673-4605-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9]]},"language":"en","page":"49-54","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Paris, France","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Personality distortion in communication through teleoperated robots","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6343730/"},

In the real world, instructions are typically given through words and body orientations such as head movements, which make it possible to project others’ actions. Projectability is an important resource in organizing multiple actions among multiple participants in co-ordination with one another. It can likewise be said that in the case of robot-human collaboration, it is necessary to design a robot’s head so that a local participant can project the robot’s (and remote person’s) actions. GestureMan is a robot that is designed to support such projectability properties. It is argued that a remote controlled mobile robot, designed as a communication medium, makes relevant dual ecologies: ecology at a remote (robot operator’s) site and at a local participant's (robot’s) site.

  {"id":"lalaSmoothTurntakingRobot2019","abstract":"Turn-taking in human-robot interaction is a crucial part of spoken dialogue systems, but current models do not allow for human-like turn-taking speed seen in natural conversation. In this work we propose combining two independent prediction models. A continuous model predicts the upcoming end of the turn in order to generate gaze aversion and fillers as turn-taking cues. This prediction is done while the user is speaking, so turn-taking can be done with little silence between turns, or even overlap. Once a speech recognition result has been received at a later time, a second model uses the lexical information to decide if or when the turn should actually be taken. We constructed the continuous model using the speaker’s prosodic features as inputs and evaluated its online performance. We then conducted a subjective experiment in which we implemented our model in an android robot and asked participants to compare it to one without turn-taking cues, which produces a response when a speech recognition result is received. We found that using both gaze aversion and a filler was preferred when the continuous model correctly predicted the upcoming end of turn, while using only gaze aversion was better if the prediction was wrong.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lala","given":"Divesh"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Kawahara","given":"Tatsuya"}],"collection-title":"ICMI '19","container-title":"2019 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction","DOI":"10.1145/3340555.3353727","event-place":"Suzhou, China","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6860-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,14]]},"page":"226–234","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"Suzhou, China","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Smooth Turn-taking by a Robot Using an Online Continuous Model to Generate Turn-taking Cues","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3340555.3353727"},

Unfortunately, the use of antibiotics selects for resistance at answering scale. The turn to the study of antibiotic resistance in microbiology and medicine is examined, focusing on the realization that individual therapies targeted at single pathogens in individual bodies are environmental events affecting bacterial evolution far beyond bodies. In turning to biological manifestations of antibiotic use, sciences fathom material outcomes of their own previous concepts. Archival work with stored soil and clinical samples produces a record described here as ‘the biology of history’: the physical registration of human history in bacterial life. This account thus foregrounds the importance of understanding both the materiality of history and the historicity of matter in theories and concepts of life today.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Landecker","given":"Hannah"}],"container-title":"Body & Society","container-title-short":"Body & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1357034X14561341","ISSN":"1357-034X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"19-52","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Antibiotic Resistance and the Biology of History","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1357034X14561341","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"langProvidingBasisHumanRobotInteraction2003","abstract":"In order to enable the widespread use of robots in home and ofﬁce environments, systems with natural interaction capabilities have to be developed. A prerequisite for natural interaction is the robot’s ability to automatically recognize when and how long a person’s attention is directed towards it for communication. As in open environments several persons can be present simultaneously, the detection of the communication partner is of particular importance. In this paper we present an attention system for a mobile robot which enables the robot to shift its attention to the person of interest and to maintain attention during interaction. Our approach is based on a method for multi-modal person tracking which uses a pan-tilt camera for face recognition, two microphones for sound source localization, and a laser range ﬁnder for leg detection. Shifting of attention is realized by turning the camera into the direction of the person which is currently speaking. From the orientation of the head it is decided whether the speaker addresses the robot. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an evaluation. In addition, qualitative results from the performance of the robot at the exhibition part of the ICVS’03 are provided.","author":[{"family":"Lang","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Kleinehagenbrock","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Hohenner","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Fritsch","given":"Jannik"},{"family":"Fink","given":"Gernot A"},{"family":"Sagerer","given":"Gerhard"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Providing the Basis for Human-Robot-Interaction: A Multi-Modal Attention System for a Mobile Robot","type":"article-journal"},

In this work, a model-based method is presented that can predict the energy efficiency of origami-based vacuum pneumatic artificial muscles (OV-PAMs) while considering the characteristics of the pump used. This model was applied using both the manufacturer’s data and experimental data to extrapolate the efficiency and flow rate of the pump which can then be used to optimize the dimensions of the actuator based on the target payload. It is then demonstrated that OV-PAMs can be used as a lightweight, low-cost, portable and powerful actuation solution paired with either batteries or solar panels and lightweight pumps. By optimizing its parameters, it will be possible to implement this actuator for the automation of low-cost off-grid operations and for field robots that can collaborate with humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jin-Gyu"},{"family":"Rodrigue","given":"Hugo"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing-Green Technology","container-title-short":"Int.

  {"id":"leeOrigamiBasedVacuumPneumatic2019","abstract":"A novel linear actuator called origami-based vacuum pneumatic artiﬁcial muscle (OV-PAM) is proposed in this study that can produce large forces (>400 N) with a contraction ratio >90% of the active length of the actuator. Moreover, some of the designs presented in this article can lift large loads with large contraction ratios at extremely low vacuum pressure (&10 kPa). This actuator consists of a sealed origami ﬁlm chamber connecting a polygonal top and bottom plate with evenly spaced transversal reinforcements that prevent the chamber from contracting laterally at certain points of the actuator under vacuum pressure. As vacuum pressure is applied, both a tension force in the walls and a vertical force on the bottom plate of the actuator generate a large contractile force, and the force on the bottom plate can produce a consistent force throughout the entire motion. A quasistatic analytical model was developed that can accurately predict the behavior of the actuator and that can be used for actuator design. OV-PAMs are lightweight, have large contractile forces throughout their entire motion and large contraction ratios. It can also produce large forces at low pressures with large cross-sectional areas. Their versatility could make them well suited for a wide range of applications. They could take us closer to a future where robots can cooperate with humans to shape a better future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jin-Gyu"},{"family":"Rodrigue","given":"Hugo"}],"container-title":"Soft Robotics","container-title-short":"Soft Robotics","DOI":"10.1089/soro.2018.0063","ISSN":"2169-5172, 2169-5180","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"109-117","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Origami-Based Vacuum Pneumatic Artificial Muscles with Large Contraction Ratios","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/soro.2018.0063","volume":"6"},

It begins by providing a brief overview of the sociomaterial perspective on organizational practices and considers why this perspective holds great appeal at this point in time. I then engage with Mutch's (2013) critique of the agential realist foundation upon which most current discussions of sociomateriality are constructed to highlight what practical problems are generated when authors attempt to map agential realism's philosophical discussion onto empirical phenomena. Next, I attempt to make explicit what Mutch leaves implicit in his paper: how building studies of sociomateriality on the theoretical foundation offered by critical realism can, potentially, overcome some of the practical problems created by a footing on agential realism. Finally, I push Mutch's arguments one step further to compare what practical consequences arise when researchers attempt to construct studies of sociomateriality on either of these two theoretical foundations. I suggest that there are important implications for what one can study, how one can study it, and how scholars can contribute to theory on technology and organizing based on the theoretical foundation they choose to build upon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Leonardi","given":"Paul M."}],"container-title":"Information and Organization","container-title-short":"Information and Organization","DOI":"10.1016/j.infoandorg.2013.02.002","ISSN":"1471-7727","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"59-76","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Theoretical foundations for the study of sociomateriality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772713000067","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"liFluiddrivenOrigamiinspiredArtificial2017","abstract":"Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90% of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg—all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Shuguang"},{"family":"Vogt","given":"Daniel M"},{"family":"Rus","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Wood","given":"Robert J"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","issue":"50","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"13132-13137","title":"Fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/content/114/50/13132.abstract","volume":"114"},

Using the 2012 American National Election Studies, we ﬁnd that the measurement of feeling thermometers is not exactly comparable between face-to-face and Web surveys. Face-to-face respondents tend to provide warmer feelings, while Web respondents give relatively more reliable responses in comparison. In both survey modes, respondents are most likely to select the response options that are verbally labeled although the effect is more striking in face-to-face than Web survey. The item nonresponse between these two modes does not differ in a meaningful way. This study ends by discussing future research directions on feeling thermometer questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Mingnan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yichen"}],"container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.057","ISSN":"07475632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"language":"en","page":"212-218","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Data collection mode effect on feeling thermometer questions: A comparison of face-to-face and Web surveys","title-short":"Data collection mode effect on feeling thermometer questions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0747563215000795","volume":"48"},

Given that both a change in movement behavior and social behavior are an objective in the contexts of aging-in-place, neurocognitive and neurophysical rehabilitation, and depression, these key mechanisms should also be included in the interaction with social companion robots in therapy and care.

Sessions included an international, gender balanced, cross generational group of over 70 musicians all of whom were living under conditions of social distancing. All sessions were recorded using Zoom software . After 3 months of twice weekly two hours improvisation sessions, 29 one-hour interviews with participants were undertaken, recorded, transcribed, and analysed. Key themes include how the sessions helped participants stay connected, provided opportunities for artistic development, enhanced mood, reduced feelings of isolation, had a positive effect on mood and sustained and developed community. Particular attention is placed upon how improvisation as a universal, real time, social, collaborative process facilitates interaction allowing the technological affordances of software (latencies, sound quality, gallery/speaker view) and hardware (laptop, tablet, instruments, microphones, headphones, objects in room) to become emergent properties of artistic collaborations. The extent to which this process affects new perceptual and conceptual breakthroughs for practitioners is discussed as is the crucial and innovative relationship between audio and visual elements. Analysis of edited films of the sessions highlight artistic and theoretical and conceptual issues discussed.

This article focuses on such reconciliation-aimed intergroup encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians that seek to reduce hostility and increase understanding and cooperation between the two nationalities. Like other contact interventions conducted in settings of intergroup conflict, encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians represent a paradoxical project: this is a project that aspires to generate equality and cooperation between groups that are embedded in a protracted asymmetrical conflict. Though existing research teaches us valuable lessons on the effectiveness of contact conducted under optimal conditions, little is said about contact between groups involved in asymmetrical protracted dispute. The goal of this analysis is to examine the evolution of reconciliation-aimed contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Palestinians in the past 20 years. The research method is qualitative, relying on ethnographic data assembled during the relevant period of time. The findings identify and trace the evolution of four major models of Jewish–Palestinian planned encounters: the Coexistence Model, the Joint Projects Model, the Confrontational Model, and the Narrative-Story-Telling Model. The strengths and limitations of each model in transforming intergroup attitudes in asymmetric conflict are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Maoz","given":"Ifat"}],"container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343310389506","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1]]},"language":"en","page":"115-125","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Does contact work in protracted asymmetrical conflict?

This approach assesses the extent to which contact interventions, aimed at improving relations between sides in dispute, actually promote among their participants relationships, behaviors, and interactions that fulfill standards of social justice, equality, and fairness. Creating equality in communication models and reinforces values of mutual respect and tolerance. Thus, establishing symmetrical communication can be especially important for many interventions conducted to resolve conflicts marked by unequal distribution of power. One such asymmetrical conflict is the one between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in Israel. This article describes a study that applies our process-evaluation approach to assess equality and social justice in planned contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Arabs by measuring the degree to which members of the two groups contributed equally to the communication between them. Finally, the article presents guidelines, derived from this and other similar studies, for establishing communication equality in other planned contact interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Maoz","given":"Ifat"}],"container-title":"Negotiation Journal","DOI":"10.1111/j.1571-9979.2005.00050.x","ISSN":"1571-9979","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2005.00050.x","page":"131-146","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Evaluating the Communication between Groups in Dispute: Equality in Contact Interventions between Jews and Arabs in Israel","title-short":"Evaluating the Communication between Groups in Dispute","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1571-9979.2005.00050.x","volume":"21"},

The present research raises a fundamental question regarding these interventions of ‘‘is there contact at all?’’ Based on previous research and observations, we claim that the occurrence of intergroup interactions in planned contact interventions between groups in conﬂict can subject to marked variability. Thus, this study’s goal is to construct and apply a measure assessing the extent of intergroup interaction in such interventions. The data was collected through observations of planned encounters between Jews and Arabs that were conducted in Israel in 1999–2000. The ﬁndings show variability in the extent of intergroup interaction in the investigated programs. While the majority of these encounters (Some 65% of them) were characterized by a high extent of intergroup interaction, some 20% of them contained a medium level of interaction and some 15% a low level one. The ﬁndings further indicate that programs targeted at high school students and adults were characterized by higher levels of intergroup interaction while programs targeted at preschool to fourth grade children and especially programs targeted at ﬁfth to ninth graders included a lower extent of such interaction. Theoretical and practical implication of these ﬁndings are discussed. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The system is developed on the assumption that movements can be emotive by processed on the basis of the correlations between movement features and expressed emotions. The movement features based on Laban movement analysis (LMA) are adopted. An experiment using a real HFR are conducted to test how well our system adds a target emotion to arbitrary movements at intended strength. The results of experiments suggest that our method succeeded in adding a target emotion to arbitrary movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Masuda","given":"Megumi"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Shohei"}],"container-title":"19th International Symposium in Robot and Human Interactive Communication","DOI":"10.1109/ROMAN.2010.5598692","event":"2010 RO-MAN: The 19th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","event-place":"Viareggio, Italy","ISBN":"978-1-4244-7991-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9]]},"language":"en","page":"324-329","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Viareggio, Italy","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Motion rendering system for emotion expression of human form robots based on Laban movement analysis","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5598692/"},

  {"id":"mazizKnittingWeavingArtificial2017","abstract":"A need exists for artificial muscles that are silent, soft, and compliant, with performance characteristics similar to those of skeletal muscle, enabling natural interaction of assistive devices with humans. By combining one of humankind’s oldest technologies, textile processing, with electroactive polymers, we demonstrate here the feasibility of wearable, soft artificial muscles made by weaving and knitting, with tunable force and strain. These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices.\nTextile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain.\nTextile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Maziz","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Concas","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Khaldi","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Stålhand","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Persson","given":"Nils-Krister"},{"family":"Jager","given":"Edwin W.

In this paper, we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zerocentered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a ﬁnite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for simpliﬁed gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We ﬁnd these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn highresolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mescheder","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Nowozin","given":"Sebastian"}],"container-title":"arXiv:1801.04406 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,31]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Which Training Methods for GANs do actually Converge?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04406"},

We also find that avatar attractiveness affects online behavioral traits such as extroversion and loudness. Lastly, we find support for a hierarchy of physical variation across online roles whereby people retain core identity elements (such as gender and race) across all their avatars, but they change peripheral elements (such as hair and clothing, and even face).

  {"id":"moriUncannyValleyField2012","abstract":"More than 40 years ago, Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, wrote an essay [1] on how he envisioned people's reactions to robots that looked and acted almost like a human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human.

These results seem to be driven by changing norms around social contact as well as a positive experience, with top-performing teams being more likely to patronize a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul.

  {"id":"murrarOvercomingResistanceChange","abstract":"Researchers and practitioners have proposed numerous methods to reduce prejudice and create more positive attitudes toward members of other groups. However, empirical support for the effectiveness of these methods is mixed at best. Here, we propose that intergroup attitudes tend to be highly resistant to change, and thus, any method aiming to change these attitudes will be effective only if it successfully overcomes this resistance. First, we argue that traditional methods used to promote positive intergroup attitudes are inadequate in this regard. Next, we suggest that narratives are a unique way of overcoming resistance because they create less reactance, transport individuals into a story world, and provide them with social models. We then describe empirical evidence suggesting that narratives are likely to be particularly useful for creating more positive attitudes toward members of other social groups. Finally, we propose a number of empirical and theoretical questions that present challenges for research on narratives and intergroup attitudes.","author":[{"family":"Murrar","given":"Sohad"},{"family":"Brauer","given":"Markus"}],"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"Overcoming Resistance to Change: Using Narratives to Create More Positive Intergroup Attitudes","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"nagendranSymmetricTelepresenceUsing2015","abstract":"Telepresence involves the use of virtual reality technology to facilitate apparent physical participation in distant events, including potentially performing tasks, while creating a sense of being in that location. Traditionally, such systems are asymmetric in nature where only one side (participant) is “teleported” to the remote location. In this manuscript, the authors explore the possibility of symmetric three-dimensional telepresence where both sides (participants) are “teleported” simultaneously to each other’s location; the overarching concept of symmetric telepresence in virtual environments is extended to telepresence robots in physical environments. Two identical physical humanoid robots located in UK and the USA serve as surrogates while performing a transcontinental shared collaborative task. The actions of these surrogate robots are driven by capturing the intent of the participants controlling them in either location. Participants could communicate verbally but could not see the other person or the remote location while performing the task. The effectiveness of gesturing along with other observations during this preliminary experiment is presented. Results reveal that the symmetric robotic telepresence allowed participants to use and understand gestures in cases where they would otherwise have to describe their actions verbally.

  {"id":"nagendranUnifiedFrameworkIndividualized2014","abstract":"This paper presents a framework to interactively control avatars in remote environments. The system, called AMITIES, serves as the central component that connects people controlling avatars (inhabiters), various manifestations of these avatars (surrogates), and people interacting with these avatars (participants). A multiserver–client architecture, based on a low-demand network protocol, connects the participant environment(s), the inhabiter station(s), and the avatars. A human-in-the-loop metaphor provides an interface for remote operation, with support for multiple inhabiters, multiple avatars, and multiple participants. Custom animation blending routines and a gesture-based interface provide inhabiters with an intuitive avatar control paradigm. This gesture control is enhanced by genres of program-controlled behaviors that can be triggered by events or inhabiter choices for individual or groups of avatars. This mixed (agency and gesture-based) control paradigm reduces the cognitive and physical loads on the inhabiter while supporting natural bidirectional conversation between participants and the virtual characters or avatar counterparts, including ones with physical manifestations, for example, robotic surrogates. The associated system affords the delivery of personalized experiences that adapt to the actions and interactions of individual users, while staying true to each virtual character’s personality and backstory. In addition to its avatar control paradigm, AMITIES provides processes for character and scenario development, testing, and reﬁnement. It also has integrated capabilities for session recording and event tagging, along with automated tools for reﬂection and after-action review. We demonstrate effectiveness by describing an instantiation of AMITIES, called TeachLivE, that is widely used by colleges of education to prepare new teachers and provide continuing professional development to existing teachers. Finally, we show the system’s ﬂexibility by describing a number of other diverse applications, and presenting plans to enhance capabilities and application areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagendran","given":"Arjun"},{"family":"Pillat","given":"Remo"},{"family":"Kavanaugh","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Welch","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Charles"}],"container-title":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","container-title-short":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","DOI":"10.1162/PRES_a_00177","ISSN":"1054-7460, 1531-3263","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8]]},"language":"en","page":"109-132","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Unified Framework for Individualized Avatar-Based Interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/PRES_a_00177","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"nashVirtualRealityWitness2018","abstract":"The notion of immersive witness underpins much of the exploration of virtual reality (VR) by journalists and humanitarian organisations. Immersive witness links the experience of VR with a moral attitude of responsibility for distant others. In accounts of media witness, the ability of the media to sustain an experience of presence has played an important, albeit often implicit, role linking the spectator spatially and temporally to distant suffering. However, the concept of media witness has to date assumed that the media represent, that news stories and documentaries present to their audiences images and sounds that communicate something of an event. VR, in contrast, seeks to simulate, providing the audience with something of an experience that is linked in various ways to the experiences of others. It is this simulative function that is seen as fundamental to VR’s moral address. This paper explores the moral potential of VR suggesting that while there is much to recommend VR as a platform for humanitarian communication there is an inherent moral risk attached: the risk of improper distance. The United Nation’s VR work serves as a case study for exploring VR’s moral potential and the risk of improper distance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Nash","given":"Kate"}],"container-title":"Studies in Documentary Film","container-title-short":"Studies in Documentary Film","DOI":"10.1080/17503280.2017.1340796","ISSN":"1750-3280, 1750-3299","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,4]]},"language":"en","page":"119-131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Virtual reality witness: exploring the ethics of mediated presence","title-short":"Virtual reality witness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17503280.2017.1340796","volume":"12"},

We argue that careful design based on an understanding of non-verbal communication can mitigate these differences. In this paper, we study the effects of video image framing in one-on-one meetings on empathy formation. We alter the video image by framing the display such that, in one condition, only the head is visible while, in the other condition, the entire upper body is visible. We include a F2F control case. We used two measures of dyad empathy and found a significant difference between head-only framing and both upper-body framing and F2F, but no significant difference between upper-body framing and F2F. Based on these and earlier results, we present some design heuristics for video conferencing systems. We revisit earlier negative experimental results on video systems in the light of these new experiments. We conclude that for systems that preserve both gaze and upper-body cues, there is no evidence of deficit in communication effectiveness compared to face-to-face meetings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nguyen","given":"David T."},{"family":"Canny","given":"John"}],"collection-title":"CHI '09","container-title":"Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/1518701.1518770","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-60558-246-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,4,4]]},"page":"423–432","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"More than face-to-face: empathy effects of video framing","title-short":"More than face-to-face","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1518701.1518770"},

It does so by outlining a vocabulary and strategy that make up a framework for theorizing work and organizational practices. The vocabulary is based on number of sensitizing concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to bear. The strategy is based on the metaphorical movement of ‘zooming in’ and ‘zooming out of’ practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and re-positioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are foregrounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the article discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practice.

The experiment varied the level of anthropomorphism of the image of interactants: high anthropomorphism, low anthropomorphism, or no image. Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computercontrolled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases telepresence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowak","given":"Kristine L."},{"family":"Biocca","given":"Frank"}],"container-title":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","container-title-short":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","DOI":"10.1162/105474603322761289","ISSN":"1054-7460, 1531-3263","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,10]]},"language":"en","page":"481-494","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Effect of the Agency and Anthropomorphism on Users' Sense of Telepresence, Copresence, and Social Presence in Virtual Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/105474603322761289","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"odonnellTechnologicalAnalyticalAdvancements","abstract":"The prolific expansion of intergroup contact research has established that intergroup interactions are tightly linked to social integration. In this review, recent technological and statistical innovations with the potential to advance this body of research are presented. First, concerns over the validity of longitudinal models are discussed before innovative analytical techniques are introduced that explore change over time. Next, intensive repeated measure designs, such as experience sampling approaches, are introduced as opportunities to investigate the day-to-day lives of individuals. Virtual reality technology is then presented as another means to examine naturalistic contact experiences in the laboratory, offering researchers an unrivaled capacity to induce uncommon contact experiences. Finally, we propose that additional sources of contextual data, such as competing media messages, could extend these models in innovative ways by accounting for the time and place surrounding intergroup contact. Similarly, longitudinal social network analysis can provide additional contextual information by considering the broader network environment in which contact occurs. We describe these innovations with the intention of spurring future research that will advance our understanding of how intergroup contact can be used to improve our societies. Thus, we conclude with a discussion on how to bridge divides between researchers and practitioners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Donnell","given":"Alexander W."},{"family":"Friehs","given":"Maria-Therese"},{"family":"Bracegirdle","given":"Chloe"},{"family":"Zúñiga","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Watt","given":"Susan Ellen"},{"family":"Barlow","given":"Fiona Kate"}],"container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/josi.12424","ISSN":"1540-4560","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/josi.12424","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Technological and analytical advancements in intergroup contact research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12424","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"oneillUnfoldingTextileBasedPneumatic2021","abstract":"Textile based pneumatic actuators have recently seen increased development for use in wearable applications thanks to their high strength to weight ratio and range of achievable actuation modalities. However, the design of these textile-based actuators is typically an iterative process due to the complexity of predicting the soft and compliant behavior of the textiles. In this work we investigate the actuation mechanics of a range of physical prototypes of unfolding textile-based actuators to understand and develop an intuition for how the geometric parameters of the actuator affect the moment it generates, enabling more deterministic designs in the future. Under benchtop conditions the actuators were characterized at a range of actuator angles and pressures (0 –136 kPa), and three distinct performance regimes were observed, which we deﬁne as Shearing, Creasing, and Flattening. During Flattening, the effects of both the length and radius of the actuator dominate with maximum moments in excess of 80 Nm being generated, while during Creasing the radius dominates with generated moments scaling with the cube of the radius. Low stiffness spring like behavior is observed in the Shearing regime, which occurs as the actuator approaches its unfolded angle. A piecewise analytical model was also developed and compared to the experimental results within each regime. Finally, a prototype actuator was also integrated into a shoulder assisting wearable robot, and on-body characterization of this robot was performed on ﬁve healthy individuals to observe the behavior of the actuators in a wearable application. Results from this characterization highlight that these actuators can generate useful on-body moments (10.74 Nm at 90° actuator angle) but that there are signiﬁcant reductions compared to bench-top performance, in particular when mostly folded and at higher pressures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Ciarán T."},{"family":"McCann","given":"Connor M."},{"family":"Hohimer","given":"Cameron J."},{"family":"Bertoldi","given":"Katia"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Conor J."}],"container-title":"Soft Robotics","container-title-short":"Soft Robotics","DOI":"10.1089/soro.2020.0064","ISSN":"2169-5172, 2169-5180","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,21]]},"language":"en","page":"soro.2020.0064","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unfolding Textile-Based Pneumatic Actuators for Wearable Applications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/soro.2020.0064"},

It was also found that types of unpleasant stimuli differed from person to person. Furthermore, we propose an automatic unpleasant stimuli avoidance system using online machine learning architecture constructed from echo state networks (ESNs) and Accumulator Based Arbitration Models (ABAMs) that can also flexibly adapt to remote users. Because the handheld telepresence robot can avoid unpleasant stimuli before remote users experience these stimuli, it provides them with a more comfortable communication environment while notifying people around the robot that uncomfortable stimulation is being avoided.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Osawa","given":"Masahiko"},{"family":"Imai","given":"Michita"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Social Robotics","container-title-short":"Int J of Soc Robotics","DOI":"10.1007/s12369-019-00551-w","ISSN":"1875-4805","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"187-199","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Robot for Test Bed Aimed at Improving Telepresence System and Evasion from Discomfort Stimuli by Online Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12369-019-00551-w","volume":"12"},

Results indicate that the beneﬁcial effects of contact at work were partially mediated by increased empathy and reduced anxiety, experienced both in the work environment and towards immigrants in general. Finally, high levels of group membership salience facilitated the inﬂuence of contact on intergroup emotions.

Despite their lightweight and simple structure, they have long inflation and deflation times, which make their quick use difficult. To resolve this issue, we propose an inflatable wrinkle actuator with fast inflation and deflation responses. First, a theoretical model is proposed to develop an actuator that satisfies the design requirements: the desired assistive torque and the foam factor based on the wearability. Second, we reduce the inflation and deflation times by partially controlling the actuator layers and by designing pneumatic circuits using a vacuum ejector. To validate the usability of the actuator in wearable suits, we applied it to a wearable knee suit, and the inflation and deflation times were 0.40 s and 0.16 s, respectively. As a result, we ensured that the actuator did not interfere with human knee joint movement during walking by creating any residual resistance.","author":[{"family":"Park","given":"J."},{"family":"Choi","given":"J."},{"family":"Kim","given":"S.

To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts.

  {"id":"peledSoftRoboticIncarnation2019","abstract":"This thesis is a postphenomenological interrogation into the use of soft robots as mediating bodies between humans, attempting to unfetishize their imaginative figure of the stranger through an event I call incarnation. Based on my own encounters with Palestinians for conflict resolution and through readings of phenomenological and sociological studies, I determine the importance of the physical body, its fleshiness, nonlinearity and organic qualities for the constitution of intercorporeality - a meaningful and transformative dialog. I investigate the potential of non-human robotic avatars to achieve intercorpreality and liberate the interlocutors from prejudice and identity constraints, proposing the use of soft robots as a medium of re-embodiment that could facilitate massive scale physical incarnations and create physical encounters between people who are unable to otherwise meet in person. As a proof-of-concept, a novel method for the production of soft robotic avatars is introduced, capable of bodily haptics, language translation, and animalistic emotional expression. The avatar is operated using a web-based software platform that enables easy development of third party applications. Using this method, HITODAMA, a first prototype for a soft robotic avatar, is produced. I perform an initial evaluation of the robot in an encounter between people of different cultures, using an example app in which they get to know one another using pictures. I analyze the results by conducting interviews with the participants, following the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis.","author":[{"family":"Peled","given":"Avner"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Aalto University","source":"AaltoDoc","title":"Soft Robotic Incarnation","type":"article","URL":"https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/41408"},

  {"id":"peraza-hernandezOrigamiinspiredActiveStructures2014","abstract":"Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has inspired the design of engineering devices and structures for decades. The underlying principles of origami are very general, which has led to applications ranging from cardboard containers to deployable space structures. More recently, researchers have become interested in the use of active materials (i.e., those that convert various forms of energy into mechanical work) to effect the desired folding behavior. When used in a suitable geometry, active materials allow engineers to create self-folding structures. Such structures are capable of performing folding and/or unfolding operations without being kinematically manipulated by external forces or moments. This is advantageous for many applications including space systems, underwater robotics, small scale devices, and selfassembling systems. This article is a survey and analysis of prior work on active self-folding structures as well as methods and tools available for the design of folding structures in general and self-folding structures in particular. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic view of the state-of-the-art in this important and evolving area. Unifying structural principles for active self-folding structures are identiﬁed and used as a basis for a quantitative and qualitative comparison of numerous classes of active materials. Design considerations speciﬁc to folded structures are examined, including the issues of crease pattern identiﬁcation and fold kinematics. Although few tools have been created with active materials in mind, many of them are useful in the overall design process for active self-folding structures. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of open questions for the ﬁeld of origami-inspired engineering.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Peraza-Hernandez","given":"Edwin A"},{"family":"Hartl","given":"Darren J"},{"family":"Malak Jr","given":"Richard J"},{"family":"Lagoudas","given":"Dimitris C"}],"container-title":"Smart Materials and Structures","DOI":"10.1088/0964-1726/23/9/094001","ISSN":"0964-1726, 1361-665X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"094001","source":"Crossref","title":"Origami-inspired active structures: a synthesis and review","title-short":"Origami-inspired active structures","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://stacks.iop.org/0964-1726/23/i=9/a=094001?key=crossref.6226c53c3ab2492e5686c0d4be08ea2e","volume":"23"},

A meta-analysis of more than 500 studies established the theory’s basic contention that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudices of many types. This paper addresses the issue of process: just how does contact diminish prejudice? We test meta-analytically the three most studied mediators: contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing empathy and perspective taking. Our tests reveal mediational effects for all three of these mediators. However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.

  {"id":"pettigrewMetaanalyticTestIntergroup2006","abstract":"The present article presents a meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory. With 713 independent samples from 515 studies, the meta-analysis finds that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport’s optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Pettigrew","given":"Thomas F."},{"family":"Tropp","given":"Linda R."}],"container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]},"language":"en","page":"751-783","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751","volume":"90"},

A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = −.21). Allport’s original conditions for optimal contact –equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction – facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal – across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice – vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs – especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Pettigrew","given":"Thomas F."},{"family":"Tropp","given":"Linda R."},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Christ","given":"Oliver"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Intercultural Relations","container-title-short":"International Journal of Intercultural Relations","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.03.001","ISSN":"01471767","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,5]]},"language":"en","page":"271-280","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent advances in intergroup contact theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0147176711000332","volume":"35"},

Here we seek to provide a unifying framework that incorporates the key aspects of entrainment as it has been studied in these varying domains. We propose that there are a number of types of entrainment that build upon pre-existing adaptations that allow organisms to perceive stimuli as rhythmic, to produce periodic stimuli, and to integrate the two using sensory feedback. We suggest that social entrainment is a special case of spatiotemporal coordination where the rhythmic signal originates from another individual. We use this framework to understand the function and evolutionary basis for coordinated rhythmic movement and to explore questions about the nature of entrainment in music and dance. The framework of entrainment presented here has a number of implications for the vocal learning hypothesis and other proposals for the evolution of coordinated rhythmic behavior across an array of species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips-Silver","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Aktipis","given":"C.

Structural violence, despite its pervasiveness and positive correlation with violent conflict, is often overlooked within key debates in peacebuilding. Arts, despite its prevalence at ground level, continue to remain outside the mainstream approaches to peacebuilding. In this article, I bring these two domains together and explore the potential of sustained engagement through theatre in building peace within violent structural narratives at community level. Based on an empirical study in West Bengal, India, I argue that theatre has the potential to bring prevalent but less-heard narratives of structural violence into communal discourse. I identify two key elements in this process: first, theatre offers a space where onstage resistance to structural violence is performed. Second, the performed resistance leads to triggering transformation within the violent structural narratives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Premaratna","given":"Nilanjana"}],"container-title":"Peacebuilding","DOI":"10.1080/21647259.2018.1491278","ISSN":"2164-7259","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,2]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/21647259.2018.1491278","page":"16-31","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Theatre for peacebuilding: transforming narratives of structural violence","title-short":"Theatre for peacebuilding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/21647259.2018.1491278","volume":"8"},

We tested the effect of a controlled, video-based vicarious-contact intervention on straight men’s (implicit and explicit) attitudes toward gay men. Findings of Experiment 1 (n = 99 German participants) failed to show direct effects but were in line with the idea that negative (situation-specific) emotions mediate the intervention effect. Experiment 2 (n = 108 U.S. participants) expanded findings: straight men with antigay preattitudes reported less negative intergroup emotions toward gay men after watching the vicarious-contact video (compared to the control condition); and less negative intergroup emotions were related to more positive attitudes toward gay men. For straight men with positive preattitudes, findings were in line with the hypothesis that positive intergroup emotions toward gay men were the relevant mediator.

  {"id":"reich-stiebertInvolveUserChanging2019","abstract":"Are students willing to accept robotic support for learning when their attitudes toward educational robots are moderate? Probably not, as evidence from psychological research has suggested that attitudes predict how people will behave toward an attitude object. Consequently, a negative view of robots could represent a strong barrier to the deployment of robots in educational environments. Attitude change might facilitate a smooth introduction of educational robots into learning settings. Thus, the present research builds on the fact that actively including end users in the prototyping process of a robot might increase positive attitudes toward it. Indeed, our research is among the ﬁrst works which demonstratethat participation in the prototyping process of an educational robot positively aﬀected attitudes toward educational robots in general and signiﬁcantly reduced educational robot anxiety. However, students' behavioral intentions toward educational robots were not inﬂuenced by participation. These ﬁndings raise intriguing questions regarding the relevance of user involvement in the development of robots. Therefore, the discussion focuses on how to improve this process and how user involvement in robot design processes provides a valuable contribution to the acceptance of social robots in everyday life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Reich-Stiebert","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Eyssel","given":"Friederike"},{"family":"Hohnemann","given":"Charlotte"}],"container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2018.09.041","ISSN":"07475632","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2]]},"language":"en","page":"290-296","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Involve the user!

The visual context of a conversation has two aspects: the information that is available to each conversant, and their beliefs about what is present for each other. In our experiment, we separated these factors for the first time and examined their impact on a spontaneous conversation. We manipulated the fact that a visual scene was shared or not and the belief that a visual scene was shared or not. Participants watched videos of actors talking about a controversial topic, then discussed their own views while looking at either a blank screen or the actors. Each believed (correctly or not) that their partner was either looking at a blank screen or the same images. We recorded conversants’ eye movements, quantified how they were coordinated, and analyzed their speech patterns. Gaze coordination has been shown to be causally related to the knowledge people share before a conversation, and the information they later recall. Here, we found that both the presence of the visual scene, and beliefs about its presence for another, influenced language use and gaze coordination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Richardson","given":"Daniel C."},{"family":"Dale","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Tomlinson","given":"John M."}],"container-title":"Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01057.x","ISSN":"1551-6709","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01057.x","page":"1468-1482","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Conversation, Gaze Coordination, and Beliefs About Visual Context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01057.x","volume":"33"},

In this article we as two non-indigenous people living in Australia attempt to work through issues of collective responsibility by focusing on what we believe are three key issues in the study of racism: 1) methodology and researcher subjectivity, 2) subjectification as a practice of racialisation and 3) racialised embodiment and its relation to power. In exploring these three issues we utilise theoretical interpretations of subjectivity and embodiment alongside a brief examination of a speech by Prime Minister Howard in order to elaborate our claim that racism is foundational to white subjectivities in Australia. By examining colonial violence and our relation to it, we seek to develop a framework within which psychological research on racism in Australia may disturb white claims to belonging by continuing to explore how racism works in the service of the ‘good nation’.

Postphenomenology presents a unique blend of insights from the philosophical traditions of phenomenology and American pragmatism, and applies them to studies of user relations to technologies. These studies provide deep descriptions of the ways technologies transform our abilities, augment our experience, and shape the world around us. This book proceeds with a preface by Don Ihde, postphenomenology’s founder, and a detailed review of the main ideas of this perspective by the editors Robert Rosenberger and Peter-Paul Verbeek. The body of this volume is composed of twelve postphenomenological essays which reflect the expansive range, detail-orientation, and interdisciplinarity of this school of thought. These essays confront a broad assortment of topics, both abstract and concrete. Abstract topics addressed include metaphysics, ethics, methodology, and analysis of the notions of selfhood, skill training, speed, and political activism. Just a few of the concrete topics studied include human-like interactive robots, ethics education, image interpretation in radiology, science fiction tropes, transportation history, wearable computing, and organ donation protocols for brain-dead bodies. The volume concludes with constructive critiques of postphenomenology by Andrew Feenberg, Diane Michelfelder, and Albert Borgmann, all figures whose work is relevant to postphenomenological projects.","author":[{"family":"Rosenberger","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Verbeek","given":"Peter-Paul"}],"DOI":"10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004","ISBN":"978-85-7811-079-6","ISSN":"1098-6596","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"number-of-pages":"283","PMID":"25246403","title":"Postphenomenological Investigations Essays.

  {"id":"rosiekNarrativeInquiryNew2020","abstract":"Agential realism—the idea that it makes sense to view the world as being composed of various forms of protean nonhuman agency—has been a topic of discussion for many social science scholars in recent years. This increase of interest in agent ontologies can be attributed to the new feminist materialist movement in the philosophy of science literature. However, agent ontologies also are found in Indigenous studies literature and in Peircean pragmatism. These latter sources are also a part of the current methodological conversation about nonhuman agency. This article explores the connections between agential realist philosophy and social science research that employs narrative forms of analysis and representation. The goal is to assist narrative researchers in avoiding oversimplification by tracing out different strands in these literatures and mapping out points of connection and disconnection in detail. Intersections that hold the promise of complementary development are highlighted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosiek","given":"Jerry Lee"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Jimmy"}],"container-title":"Qualitative Inquiry","container-title-short":"Qualitative Inquiry","DOI":"10.1177/1077800418784326","ISSN":"1077-8004, 1552-7565","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1151-1162","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Narrative Inquiry and New Materialism: Stories as (Not Necessarily Benign) Agents","title-short":"Narrative Inquiry and New Materialism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077800418784326","volume":"26"},

These animals have mastered the ability to repair and replace most of their tissues following damage or amputation even well into adulthood. In fact it seems that the ability of these organisms to regenerate perfectly is not affected by their age. In addition to being able to regenerate, these animals display a remarkable resistance to cancer. They therefore represent a unique model organism to study regeneration and cancer resistance in vertebrates. The need for this research is even more pressing at the dawn of the 21st century as we are faced with an ever aging world population which has to deal with an increase in organ failure and cancer incidence. Hopefully, this mini review will put in perspective some of the reasons why studying tissue regeneration in salamanders could yield signiﬁcant knowledge to help regenerative medicine achieve the desired goal of allowing humans to repair and regenerate some of their own tissues as they age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Gatien","given":"Samuel"}],"container-title":"Experimental Gerontology","DOI":"10.1016/j.exger.2008.09.003","ISSN":"05315565","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11]]},"language":"en","note":"Avner","page":"968-973","source":"Crossref","title":"Regeneration in axolotls: a model to aim for!","title-short":"Regeneration in axolotls","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0531556508002933","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"rozmyslowiczMachineTranslationProblem2014","abstract":"This paper argues that machine translation has so far not been identified as a translation theoretical problem. It further argues that this is not accidental but a symptom of certain theoretical and methodological predispositions. These refer to normative moments in the conceptual foundations of those research paradigms in translation studies that are oriented towards the concepts of agency and culture. The aim of this paper is to problematize these predispositions and propose a conceptual framework in which machine translation can be identified as a problem for translation theory and directed towards possible solutions. It will be shown that the concepts of culture, translator and communication must be newly interrelated in order to secure and justify the object-relation of translation studies in the face of new forms of translation.","author":[{"family":"Rozmyslowicz","given":"Tomasz"}],"container-title":"Machine Translation","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"19","source":"Zotero","title":"Machine Translation: A Problem for Translation Theory","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"saguyIronyHarmonyIntergroup2009","abstract":"Positive intergroup contact has been a guiding framework for research on reducing intergroup tension and for interventions aimed at that goal. We propose that beyond improving attitudes toward the out-group, positive contact affects disadvantaged-group members’ perceptions of intergroup inequality in ways that can undermine their support for social change toward equality. In Study 1, participants were assigned to either high- or lowpower experimental groups and then brought together to discuss either commonalities between the groups or intergroup differences. Commonality-focused contact, relative to difference-focused contact, produced heightened expectations for fair (i.e., egalitarian) out-group behavior among members of disadvantaged groups. These expectations, however, proved unrealistic when compared against the actions of members of the advantaged groups. Participants in Study 2 were Israeli Arabs (a disadvantaged minority) who reported the amount of positive contact they experienced with Jews. More positive intergroup contact was associated with increased perceptions of Jews as fair, which in turn predicted decreased support for social change. Implications for social change are considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Saguy","given":"Tamar"},{"family":"Tausch","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Dovidio","given":"John F."},{"family":"Pratto","given":"Felicia"}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02261.x","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,1]]},"language":"en","page":"114-121","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Irony of Harmony: Intergroup Contact Can Produce False Expectations for Equality","title-short":"The Irony of Harmony","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02261.x","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"saguyRoleGroupPower2013","abstract":"An extensive meta-analysis of the contact literature, summarizing over five hundred studies across a wide range of contexts and countries, found that although intergroup contact was related to improved attitudes among members of both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, it was found to be significantly less effective for improving the outgroup attitudes of disadvantaged group members than those of advantaged group members. Furthermore, optimal conditions in the contact situation (e.g., cooperation, equal status, institutional support) were found to facilitate the effect of contact only for members of advantaged groups; the presence of these conditions did not have a significant impact on disadvantaged group members involved in intergroup contact. Researchers have begun to consider differences in how advantaged versus disadvantaged group members approach, experience, and are affected by intergroup contact. For instance, findings from a U.S. national survey show that while positive effects of contact are typically observed among White Americans, they are significantly inhibited among Black Americans who perceive high levels of discrimination against their racial group. Experimental and diary studies further indicate that exposure to prejudice and discrimination can undermine minorities' willingness to engage in contact with members of the advantaged majority group. Still, such findings offer little information regarding the ways in which group differences in power are enacted in contact settings, or how intergroup contact can either perpetuate or ameliorate group differences in power. In this chapter, we review emerging evidence that can advance our understanding of the intersection of power and contact between groups. We begin by considering how psychological processes associated with group position (i.e., advantaged versus disadvantaged group membership) relate to how people approach contact situations in terms of their goals and preferences for the content of intergroup encounters. We then describe research that links the consequences of intergroup contact to power asymmetries between groups and to processes that promote social change. We conclude by discussing the implications of this work for research and practice on improving intergroup relations.

  {"id":"sassenbergAttitudeChangeFacetoface2005","abstract":"Two types of social inﬂuence can be distinguished: norm-based inﬂuence occurs when social identity is salient and interpersonal inﬂuence occurs when personal identity is salient. In two experiments the impact of trait and state private self-awareness on interpersonal inﬂuence during face-to-face and computer-mediated communication (CMC) was investigated. It is argued that interpersonal inﬂuence resulting from face-to-face communication is stronger than interpersonal inﬂuence resulting from CMC because CMC heightens state private self-awareness. As a result, it leads to a focus on personal perceptions and thoughts which in turn reduces attitude change. Experiment 1 suggests that communication media may inﬂuence attitude change via private self-awareness. Experiment 2 showed that trait private self-awareness moderates the effect of communication media on interpersonal inﬂuence. Interpersonal inﬂuence was stronger in face-to-face communication than in CMC only for individuals higher in private self-awareness. This ﬁnding indicates that the impact of situational variations of a concept can be limited to individuals who have a more elevated sense of private selfawareness.

Other types of elementary components, such as soft smart structures or soft-rigid hybrid systems, are then presented. The second part of this review deals with the manufacturing methods used to build complete soft structures. It includes molding, with possibly reinforcements and inclusions, additive manufacturing, thin-ﬁlm manufacturing, shape deposition manufacturing, and bonding.

  {"id":"schneidermanMutualInfluencesPartners2014","abstract":"Early-stage romantic love involves reorganization of neurohormonal systems and behavioral patterns marked by mutual influences between the partners' physiology and behavior. Guided by the biobehavioral synchrony conceptual frame, we tested bidirectional influences between the partners' hormones and conflict behavior at the initiation of romantic love. Participants included 120 new lovers (60 couples) and 40 singles. Plasma levels of five affiliation and stress-related hormones were assessed: oxytocin (OT), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T), cortisol (CT), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Couples were observed in conflict interaction coded for empathy and hostility. CT and DHEAS showed direct actor effects: higher CT and DHEAS predicted greater hostility. OT showed direct partner effects: individuals whose partners had higher OT showed greater empathy. T and CT showed combined actor-partner effects. High T predicted greater hostility only when partner also had high T, but lower hostility when partner had low T. Similarly, CT predicted low empathy only in the context of high partner's CT. Mediational analysis indicated that combined high CT in both partners was associated with relationship breakup as mediated by decrease in empathy. Findings demonstrate the mutual influences between hormones and behavior within an attachment bond and underscore the dynamic, co-regulated, and systemic nature of pair-bond formation in humans.","author":[{"family":"Schneiderman","given":"Inna"},{"family":"Kanat-Maymon","given":"Yaniv"},{"family":"Zagoory-Sharon","given":"Orna"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Ruth"}],"container-title":"Social Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Soc Neurosci","DOI":"10.1080/17470919.2014.893925","ISSN":"1747-0927","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"eng","page":"337-351","PMID":"24579960","source":"PubMed","title":"Mutual influences between partners' hormones shape conflict dialog and relationship duration at the initiation of romantic love","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"schneidermanOxytocinInitialStages2012","abstract":"Romantic relationships can have a profound effect on adults' health and well-being whereas the inability to maintain intimate bonds has been associated with physical and emotional distress. Studies in monogamous mammalian species underscore the central role of oxytocin (OT) in pair-bonding and human imaging studies implicate OT-rich brain areas in early romantic love. To assess the role of OT in romantic attachment, we examined plasma OT in 163 young adults: 120 new lovers (60 couples) three months after the initiation of their romantic relationship and 43 non-attached singles. Twenty-five of the 36 couples who stayed together were seen again six months later. Couples were observed in dyadic interactions and were each interviewed regarding relationship-related thoughts and behaviors. OT was significantly higher in new lovers compared to singles, F(1,152)=109.33, p<.001, which may suggest increased activity of the oxytocinergic system during the early stages of romantic attachment. These high levels of OT among new lovers did not decrease six months later and showed high individual stability. OT correlated with the couples' interactive reciprocity, including social focus, positive affect, affectionate touch, and synchronized dyadic states, and with anxieties and worries regarding the partner and the relationship, findings which parallel those described for parent-infant bonding. OT levels at the first assessment differentiated couples who stayed together six months later from those who separated during this period. Regression analysis showed that OT predicted interactive reciprocity independent of sex, relationship duration, and the partner's OT. Findings suggest that OT may play an important role at the first stages of romantic attachment and lend support to evolutionary models suggesting that parental and romantic attachment share underlying bio-behavioral mechanisms.","author":[{"family":"Schneiderman","given":"Inna"},{"family":"Zagoory-Sharon","given":"Orna"},{"family":"Leckman","given":"James F."},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Ruth"}],"container-title":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","container-title-short":"Psychoneuroendocrinology","DOI":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.12.021","ISSN":"1873-3360","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"1277-1285","PMCID":"PMC3936960","PMID":"22281209","source":"PubMed","title":"Oxytocin during the initial stages of romantic attachment: relations to couples' interactive reciprocity","title-short":"Oxytocin during the initial stages of romantic attachment","type":"article-journal","volume":"37"},

Relying on data collected from nine entrepreneurs in the virtual world Second Life (SL), this paper asks how embodied identity is performed in virtual worlds. Contrasting representationalism with performativity, this study highlights that the SL entrepreneurs intentionally re-presented in their avatars some of the attributes of physical bodies, but that they also engaged in habitual practices in-world, thereby unconsciously enacting embodied identities in both their ‘real’ and virtual lives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Schultze","given":"Ulrike"}],"container-title":"European Journal of Information Systems","DOI":"10.1057/ejis.2012.52","ISSN":"0960-085X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2012.52","page":"84-95","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Performing embodied identity in virtual worlds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2012.52","volume":"23"},

To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice.

These framings result in research detailing characteristics, personal identities, and behaviors of large numbers of connected and interacting individuals, while the social identity concepts that lead to intra- and inter-group dynamics have received less attention. We argue that the emergent properties of self-categorization and social identity, which are particularly fluid and complex in online spaces, provide a complementary perspective with which to re-examine traditional topics in social computing. We discuss the applicability of the Social Identity Perspective to established and new research domains in CSCW, proposing alternative perspectives on self-presentation, social support, collaboration, conflict, and leadership. We note methodological considerations emerging from this theory.

This work has proven to be informative about behavioral and brain mechanisms that mediate links between perceptual and motor processes invoked during the observation and execution of spatially–temporally coordinated action and interpersonal interaction. The review focuses speciﬁcally on processes related to (a) motor experience and expertise, (b) learning and memory, (c) action, intention, and emotion understanding, and (d) audio-visual synchrony and timing. Consideration is given to the relationship between research on dance and more general embodied cognition accounts of action understanding and social cognition. Finally, open questions and issues concerning experimental design are discussed with a view to stimulating future research on social-cognitive aspects of dance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Sevdalis","given":"Vassilis"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Peter E."}],"container-title":"Brain and Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.bandc.2011.08.005","ISSN":"02782626","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,11]]},"language":"en","page":"231-236","source":"Crossref","title":"Captured by motion: Dance, action understanding, and social cognition","title-short":"Captured by motion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0278262611001321","volume":"77"},
  {"id":"shafirEmotionRegulationMovement2016","abstract":"We have recently demonstrated that motor execution, observation, and imagery of movements expressing certain emotions can enhance corresponding affective states and therefore could be used for emotion regulation. But which speciﬁc movement(s) should one use in order to enhance each emotion? This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identiﬁed the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which speciﬁc motor elements enhance speciﬁc emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one’s personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others’ speciﬁc movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Shafir","given":"Tal"},{"family":"Tsachor","given":"Rachelle P."},{"family":"Welch","given":"Kathleen B."}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Thanks to the composite mechanical characteristics similar to those of silicone elastomers, the actuator exhibits a bending angle of 170.3 {\\deg} and a blocked force of 0.34 N at the applied pressure of 25 kPa. These values are comparable to elastomer based pneumatic actuators.

On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one’s status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one’s image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties’ willingness to reconcile.

  {"id":"smithHealthcareInformationTechnology2014","abstract":"Objective To model inconsistencies or distortions among three realities: patients’ physical reality; clinicians’ mental models of patients’ conditions, laboratories, etc; representation of that reality in electronic health records (EHR). To serve as a potential tool for quality improvement of EHRs.\nMethods Using observations, literature, information technology (IT) logs, vendor and US Food and Drug Administration reports, we constructed scenarios/models of how patients’ realities, clinicians’ mental models, and EHRs can misalign to produce distortions in comprehension and treatment. We then categorized them according to an emergent typology derived from the cases themselves and reﬁned the categories based on insights gained from the literature of interactive sociotechnical systems analysis, decision support science, and human computer interaction. Typical of grounded theory methods, the categories underwent repeated modiﬁcations.\nResults We constructed 45 scenarios of misalignment between patients’ physical realities, clinicians’ mental models, and EHRs. We then identiﬁed ﬁve general types of misrepresentation in these cases: IT data too narrowly focused; IT data too broadly focused; EHRs miss critical reality; data multiplicities–perhaps contradictory or confusing; distortions from data reﬂected back and forth across users, sensors, and others. The 45 scenarios are presented, organized by the ﬁve types.\nConclusions With humans, there is a physical reality and actors’ mental models of that reality. In healthcare, there is another player: the EHR/healthcare IT, which implicitly and explicitly reﬂects many mental models, facets of reality, and measures thereof that vary in reliability and consistency. EHRs are both microcosms and shapers of medical care.

  {"id":"smithStoriesNewMaterialism2020","abstract":"This article introduces narrative analysis as a way of engaging with storied data. Some key assumptions are first unpacked, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings of narrative research. The approach to narrative described in this article derives from narrative constructionism. This assumes that stories do more than simply reflect or recount experience: they act in people's lives in ways that matter deeply. The paper then distinguishes between two broad standpoints for approaching analysis, those of ‘story analyst’ and ‘storyteller’, before going on to describe how to conduct a particular form of constructionist narrative analysis –dialogical narrative analysis. The paper goes on by introducing an emerging trend of thought that attempts to reach beyond the shortcomings of narrative constructionism. That is new materialism. Shifting the analytical focus from stories and narratives to assemblages, new materialism is interested in how narrative and materiality affect each other within networks of human and non-human actors. After discussing what this might mean for researchers, pluralism is presented as an opportunity to combine different analytical worlds in a single study. Finally, an uncommon articulation of pluralism termed diffractive reading is highlighted and exemplified though a study combining narrative dialogism and new materialism. The paper closes with thoughts on the future of narrative in companionship with alternative approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Brett"},{"family":"Monforte","given":"Javier"}],"container-title":"Methods in Psychology","container-title-short":"Methods in Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.metip.2020.100016","ISSN":"2590-2601","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100016","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Stories, new materialism and pluralism: Understanding, practising and pushing the boundaries of narrative analysis","title-short":"Stories, new materialism and pluralism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590260120300035","volume":"2"},

How do we understand the intra-activity of such elements in children’s night-time dreams? In this article, I discuss some of these issues, while bringing together Karen Barad’s agential realism and Giorgio Agamben’s concept of ‘potentiality’ to enhance and refine my analytical approach to real–virtual enactments. This theoretical framework allows me to question the potentialities of gaming, movies and dreams as they enter intra-activities with the comprehensive set of apparatuses that enact a child’s agency, subjectivity and relational practices. The analyses and conceptual refinements that I present here are based on empirical data involving interviews with and observations of children between 8 and 14 years of age.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Søndergaard","given":"Dorte Marie"}],"container-title":"Subjectivity","container-title-short":"Subjectivity","DOI":"10.1057/sub.2012.23","ISSN":"1755-6341, 1755-635X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,4]]},"language":"en","page":"55-78","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Virtual materiality, potentiality and subjectivity: How do we conceptualize real-virtual interaction embodied and enacted in computer gaming, imagination and night dreams?","title-short":"Virtual materiality, potentiality and subjectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1057/sub.2012.23","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"spiegelEthicsVirtualReality2018","abstract":"This article explores four major areas of moral concern regarding virtual reality (VR) technologies. First, VR poses potential mental health risks, including Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. Second, VR technology raises serious concerns related to personal neglect of users’ own actual bodies and real physical environments. Third, VR technologies may be used to record personal data which could be deployed in ways that threaten personal privacy and present a danger related to manipulation of users’ beliefs, emotions, and behaviors. Finally, there are other moral and social risks associated with the way VR blurs the distinction between the real and illusory. These concerns regarding VR naturally raise questions about public policy. The article makes several recommendations for legal regulations of VR that together address each of the above concerns. It is argued that these regulations would not seriously threaten personal liberty but rather would protect and enhance the autonomy of VR consumers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Spiegel","given":"James S."}],"container-title":"Science and Engineering Ethics","container-title-short":"Sci Eng Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s11948-017-9979-y","ISSN":"1353-3452, 1471-5546","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1537-1550","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Ethics of Virtual Reality Technology: Social Hazards and Public Policy Recommendations","title-short":"The Ethics of Virtual Reality Technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11948-017-9979-y","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"stupacherSynchronySympathySocial2017","abstract":"Interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking at the same pace or dancing to the same beat, can strengthen pro-social behavior and affiliation. People all over the world come together every now and then to become entrained with a shared musical rhythm. Thus, the social and emotional power of music might further tighten interpersonal bonds. In the current study, we investigated whether social entrainment affects affiliation and helpfulness more strongly when tapping to music compared with a metronome. The between-subjects design consisted of four groups: tapping to the beat of music or to an isochronous metronome with an experimenter who tapped synchronously or asynchronously. The results of an implicit test showed that when listening to music, participants were more helpful toward a person who tapped synchronously compared with asynchronously. No such effect was found when listening and tapping to a metronome. The results of explicit ratings of the experimenter’s likability, however, did not confirm this effect. Music is a product of social interactions and might even be the result of evolutionary adaptation. Thus, we conclude that interpersonal synchrony or asynchrony during listening to music can fulfill or violate hard-wired social expectations. Compared with the experience of just moving in synchrony with a simple isochronous timekeeper, such as a metronome, social entrainment with music might increase social bonding by adding an extra layer of affective and neurophysiological mechanisms. The current experiment additionally shows that implicit or indirect measures can help elucidate how music, entrainment, affiliation, and pro-social behavior are connected.

We hypothesize that a child-operated telepresence robot that offers physical participation and operability will help to address this issue. To investigate this hypothesis, we conduct a ﬁeld experiment with 52 participants (4–8 years old) in classroom environments, and the use of a telepresence robot system is compared with a baseline Skype condition.

  {"id":"taylorInterracialContactVirtual2020","abstract":"Interracial interactions are occurring more frequently in virtual reality (VR) environments (e.g., multiplayer games, virtual classrooms, medical appointments). Individuals bring their biases and prejudices with them as they enter virtual spaces. Drawing from theories of real-world interracial interaction, predictable affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes undermine the quality of live interracial interactions. Emerging research using VR suggests that these same challenges occur in virtual social interactions. These challenges can be addressed using evidence-based best practices and policy recommendations: Improving racial/ethnic representation in VR, regulating codes of conduct, ensuring transparency about privacy/consent, and reducing explicit and implicit racist behavior. Following these recommendations can improve VR interracial contact and, in turn, realworld interracial interactions. While VR can serve as a unique tool to bring people together, carefully considered policies must mitigate the negative effects of racial bias that can hinder the progress of improved interracial interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Valerie Jones"},{"family":"Valladares","given":"Juan José"},{"family":"Siepser","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Yantis","given":"Caitlyn"}],"container-title":"Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences","container-title-short":"Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1177/2372732220943638","ISSN":"2372-7322, 2372-7330","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10]]},"language":"en","page":"132-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interracial Contact in Virtual Reality: Best Practices","title-short":"Interracial Contact in Virtual Reality","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2372732220943638","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"teichmanIntergroupBiasesConflict2007","abstract":"This study examined the proposition derived from the integrative developmental contextual theory (IDCT) (Bar-Tal & Teichman, 2005; Teichman & Bar-Tal, in press) that contextual circumstances determining collective self esteem (i.e. conflict and social status), and developmental stage in which identity development is a central issue (pre- and early adolescence) would influence intergroup biases. This proposition was previously examined with Israeli Jewish participants and here is re-examined in three samples, aged 8—17, including Israeli Arabs and two groups from the Palestinian Authority. The three samples were based in different intergroup contexts in which their group status was relatively high, medium or low. The findings demonstrate differences in the relationship between contextually defined collective self-esteem and intergroup attitudes. Results confirmed the hypothesis that in conflict, irrespective of age highest intergroup biases would be displayed by the high status group. However, the hypothesis that the lowest status group would express only more negativity toward the out-group was not confirmed. The developmental hypothesis that pre- and early adolescents from the high status group would express most varied and extreme biases was also confirmed. With some exceptions in the middle status group, all older adolescents displayed moderation in biases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Teichman","given":"Yona"},{"family":"Bar-Tal","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Abdolrazeq","given":"Yasmina"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Behavioral Development","container-title-short":"International Journal of Behavioral Development","DOI":"10.1177/0165025407081470","ISSN":"0165-0254, 1464-0651","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,9]]},"language":"en","page":"423-432","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Intergroup biases in conflict: Reexamination with Arab pre-adolescents and adolescents","title-short":"Intergroup biases in conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0165025407081470","volume":"31"},

In our analysis, we identified social norms that were formed around the prevailing sharing practices in the two sites and compared them in relation to the sharing mechanisms. The analysis revealed that automated and manual sharing were sanctioned differently.

The common ingroup identity model predicts that individuals maintain multiple identities at any given time based on roles, demographics, and contextual factors, and that they interpret others based on similarity (i.e., perceived ingroup) or dissimilarity (i.e., perceived outgroup) to these identities. In this experiment, we manipulated two aspects of a virtual partner’s identity—race and task collaboration—to determine how users would perceive others in a virtual world. White participants (N = 99) played an anagram game competitively (outgroup) or cooperatively (ingroup) in a virtual environment with a black (outgroup) or white (ingroup) virtual partner. Contrary to hypotheses, performing either task led to more positive evaluations of black avatars than white avatars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Vang","given":"Mao H."},{"family":"Fox","given":"Jesse"}],"container-title":"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","container-title-short":"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking","DOI":"10.1089/cyber.2013.0289","ISSN":"2152-2715, 2152-2723","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4]]},"language":"en","page":"235-240","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Race in Virtual Environments: Competitive Versus Cooperative Games with Black or White Avatars","title-short":"Race in Virtual Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cyber.2013.0289","volume":"17"},

For this experiment, we designed a novel protocol to induce changes in the robot's group and study different social contexts. In addition, we implemented a perception system to track participants and control the robot's orientation and gaze with little human intervention. The results showed that the gaze behaviors under consideration affected the participants' perception of the robot's motion and that its motion affected human perception of its gaze. This mutual dependency implies that robot gaze and body motion must be designed and controlled jointly, rather than independently of each other. Moreover, the orientation behaviors that we studied led to similar feelings of inclusion and sense of belonging to the robot's group, suggesting that both can be primitives for more complex orientation behaviors.","author":[{"family":"Vázquez","given":"Marynel"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"McDorman","given":"Braden"},{"family":"Forlizzi","given":"Jodi"},{"family":"Steinfeld","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Scott E."}],"container-title":"2017 12th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI","event":"2017 12th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI","ISSN":"2167-2148","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"page":"42-52","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Towards Robot Autonomy in Group Conversations: Understanding the Effects of Body Orientation and Gaze","title-short":"Towards Robot Autonomy in Group Conversations","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"walkerExplorationMindfulnessRelation2016","abstract":"Background\nThis article will look at the viability of the inclusion of mindfulness into the nursing curriculum. In nursing, the environment rarely allows the time for contemplation, though reflection is encouraged specifically in regard to the care we confer on our patients and how that impacts on us professionally. Student nurses are taught to hide their feelings to a point where they cannot find it themselves under their professional armour. Mindfulness is a possible way of bridging this gap.\nDiscussion\nOur nursing code is geared to safeguard the patient from any harm as well as our colleagues but little is done or said in support of our own personal psychological or emotional health. The helping professions are restricted by legislation which has had an impact of fostering caution and fearfulness. In using mindfulness it can be seen as a possibility in building a bridge between what actually happens in a nurse's professional life and the possibility of reengaging with that internal emotional space. If student nurses begin to incorporate mindfulness techniques, in reality this should make a difference. This was experienced with students doing these exercises, who reported anecdotally feeling more centred. As they have progressed in the course feedback from the students using the techniques has been positive not only for the students but also for them using the skills in a clinical setting, benefiting patients.\nConclusion\nMindfulness has been used as a part of the modality of health care. It is clear that mindfulness is another way of dealing with the stressors of the modern heath service in which the students are being introduced. Incorporating this coping strategy into the curriculum ensures that students will have the tools to deal with the stressors of the course, which in turn will enhance the student experience.","author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Moira"},{"family":"Mann","given":"Robert A."}],"container-title":"Nurse Education Today","container-title-short":"Nurse Education Today","DOI":"10.1016/j.nedt.2016.03.005","ISSN":"0260-6917","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,1]]},"page":"188-190","title":"Exploration of mindfulness in relation to compassion, empathy and reflection within nursing education","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691716001040","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"walkerTacklingStigmaAssociated2013","abstract":"Although evidence abounds that people with intellectual disabilities are exposed to stigma and discrimination, few interventions have attempted to tackle stigma among the general public. This study set out to assess the impact of two brief indirect contact interventions on lay people’s inclusion attitudes, social distance and positive behavioral intentions, and to explore emotional reactions towards the two interventions. 925 participants completed the ﬁrst online survey. Participants were randomized to watch either a 10 min ﬁlm based on intergroup contact theory, or a ﬁlm based on a protest message. In total, 403 participants completed the follow-up survey at one month. Both interventions were effective at changing inclusion attitudes and social distance in the short term and these effects were partially maintained at one month. The protest based intervention had a greater effect compared to the contact one on aspects of inclusion attitudes and evoked stronger emotional reactions. Despite small effect sizes, brief indirect contact interventions may have a potential role in tackling public stigma associated with intellectual disability but their effects on behavioral intentions are questionable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Scior","given":"Katrina"}],"container-title":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","container-title-short":"Research in Developmental Disabilities","DOI":"10.1016/j.ridd.2013.03.024","ISSN":"08914222","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,7]]},"language":"en","page":"2200-2210","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tackling stigma associated with intellectual disability among the general public: A study of two indirect contact interventions","title-short":"Tackling stigma associated with intellectual disability among the general public","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0891422213001285","volume":"34"},

Two sets of control subjects who did not participate in virtual groups provided comparative data. An interaction of the virtual groups experience Â religious/cultural membership affected prejudice toward different religious/cultural target groups, by reducing prejudice toward the respective outgroups for whom the greatest initial enmity existed.

Flexible pneumatic actuators have been broadly explored in soft robotic engineering field where large strokes are required to interface with human body in delicate environments. Some of them have successfully demonstrated the capability of contracting, extending, bending, and/or twisting. This paper presents a precise and effective way of designing a pneumatic bending actuator by using finite element analysis (FEA) modelling and pure winding technique. The proposed pneumatic bending actuator (PBA) is capable of generating satisfactory force and bending displacement upon internal air pressurization, and also maintains low profile, light weight, compliant nature and robustness against pressurization. The prototype actuators with a length of 220 mm, internal diameter of 9 mm and a thickness of 2 mm have been verified to achieve an angular displacement of 171° at its free end and produce bending force 7.1 N at an operating pressure of 0.675 MPa.

However, in addition to these positive aspects, digital technology also provides an effective medium for spreading hateful content in the form of cyberbullying, bigotry, hateful ideologies, and harassment of individuals and groups. This research aims to investigate the growing body of online hate research (OHR) by mapping general research indices, prevalent themes of research, research hotspots, and influential stakeholders such as organizations and contributing regions. For this, we use scientometric techniques and collect research papers from the Web of Science core database published through March 2019. We apply a predefined search strategy to retrieve peer-reviewed OHR and analyze the data using CiteSpace software by identifying influential papers, themes of research, and collaborating institutions. Our results show that higher-income countries contribute most to OHR, with Western countries accounting for most of the publications, funded by North American and European funding agencies. We also observed increased research activity post-2005, starting from more than 50 publications to more than 550 in 2018. This applies to a number of publications as well as citations. The hotbeds of OHR focus on cyberbullying, social media platforms, co-morbid mental disorders, and profiling of aggressors and victims. Moreover, we identified four main clusters of OHR: (1) Cyberbullying, (2) Sexual solicitation and intimate partner violence, (3) Deep learning and automation, and (4) Extremist and online hate groups, which highlight the cross-disciplinary and multifaceted nature of OHR as a field of research. The research has implications for researchers and policymakers engaged in OHR and its associated problems for individuals and society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Waqas","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Salminen","given":"Joni"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Soon-gyo"},{"family":"Almerekhi","given":"Hind"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Bernard J."}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0222194","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e0222194","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Mapping online hate: A scientometric analysis on research trends and hotspots in research on online hate","title-short":"Mapping online hate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222194","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"weberTakingOntologicalMaterialist2020","abstract":"Karen Barad’s (2007) agential realism conceives the world as intra-acting agencies that take definite form only when an agential cut is made. In the information systems discipline, her theory underpins much of the work that goes under the rubric of sociomateriality. Importantly, her work challenges the validity of theories about the world based on representationalism and so-called Cartesian dualism. At least some scholars who subscribe to sociomateriality argue that one consequence of Barad’s theory is that information systems theories such as representation theory stand on shaky grounds. I subject this proposition to scrutiny. I begin by summarizing the major tenets of representation theory and agential realism. Next, I use agential realism to provide an account of phenomena that are associated with an accounting information systems case study. I then evaluate the account, particularly from the perspective of what novel, innovative insights occur by using an agential realism lens. Compared to existing theories such as actor-network theory and general systems theory, I conclude that little new is learned. Moreover, I argue that representation theory provides an alternative, robust account of the case-study phenomena. I also consider the question of whether agential realism potentially provides accounting information systems scholars with a means of identifying the core of their field and constructing theories about any core they might identify.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Ron"}],"container-title":"International Journal of Accounting Information Systems","container-title-short":"International Journal of Accounting Information Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.accinf.2020.100485","ISSN":"1467-0895","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100485","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Taking the ontological and materialist turns: Agential realism, representation theory, and accounting information systems","title-short":"Taking the ontological and materialist turns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1467089520300531","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"wesselDoesDiversityUrban2009","abstract":"ABSTRACT. Contemporary urban theory has started to question the elevation of diversity as a panacea for enduring urban problems – segregation, prejudice and intergroup hostility. This critique coincides with an opposite tendency within classic contact theory and research. The latter tradition has developed an increasing enthusiasm for face-to-face interaction. The contact hypothesis, which presupposes established contact, has received conclusive support independent of target groups and contact settings. Research on ‘lived diversity’, which includes both contact and lack of contact, offers two supplementary insights. It shows, on the one hand, that boundaries are inscribed in social spaces. Physical proximity between ethnic and social groups tends to have a minor effect on interaction. Interaction, on the other hand, is not essential to attitude formation. Both subfields within contact research have confirmed that urban space may act as a catalyst for tolerant attitudes. This observation corresponds with increasing recognition of affective states, such as empathy, anxiety and group threat. Contact research has therefore, in summary, transcended the scope of the contact hypothesis. It has expanded into the realm of urban theory, which foreshadows future collaboration between the two traditions. Some key points for such exchange are suggested at the end of the article. Future research should combine an open-ended approach to casual contact with a diversified conception of diversity and a richer conception of urban space. A move in this direction would leave substantial space for geographical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wessel","given":"Terje"}],"container-title":"Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1468-0467.2009.00303.x","ISSN":"1468-0467","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-0467.2009.00303.x","page":"5-17","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Does Diversity in Urban Space Enhance Intergroup Contact and Tolerance?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0467.2009.00303.x","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"whiteImprovingIntergroupRelations2015","abstract":"In this Internet age where computer classrooms, smart phones, and tablet devices are becoming the norm, it is timely that social and educational psychologists integrate such technologies within the field of intergroup relations to develop innovative, effective, and validated tools to promote intergroup harmony. This critical review article introduces a new online contact strategy—Electronic- or E-contact—that allows for physically segregated ingroup and outgroup members to synchronously interact online, in a prestructured format. The synchronous nature of the intergroup interaction allows for the engagement of self in the contact situation that in turn strengthens the effectiveness of E-contact in promoting intergroup harmony. Previous research investigating online contact is reviewed, and an evaluation of a best-practice E-contact framework is provided. This framework is based on the successful 9-week Dual Identity Electronic Contact (DIEC) program that has been shown to maintain reductions in intergroup bias between Muslim and Christian students at 3 time periods: 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-DIEC intervention. Limitations of the Internet with regard to potentially creating negative contact are also highlighted to offer a balanced critique. Finally, future research designs are proposed to further support and enhance the success of E-contact research to improve intergroup relations and promote peace.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"White","given":"Fiona A."},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Lauren J."},{"family":"Abu-Rayya","given":"Hisham M."}],"container-title":"Review of General Psychology","container-title-short":"Review of General Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/gpr0000036","ISSN":"1089-2680, 1939-1552","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6]]},"language":"en","page":"129-139","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improving Intergroup Relations in the Internet Age: A Critical Review","title-short":"Improving Intergroup Relations in the Internet Age","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000036","volume":"19"},

Meanwhile, personal and professional communication has moved from face-to-face to computer-mediated environments, but there is little understanding on how the characteristics of these environments aﬀect the quality of interaction and joint problem solving. To develop this understanding, methods are needed for measuring success of collaboration. For this purpose, we created a collaborative block design task intended to evaluate and quantify pair performance. In this task, participants need to share information to complete visuospatial puzzles. Two versions of the task are described: a physical version and one that can be completed in virtual reality. A preliminary study was conducted with the physical version (N = 18 pairs) and the results were used to develop the task for a second study in virtual reality (N = 31 pairs). Performance measures were developed for the task, and we found that pair performance was normally distributed and positively associated with visuospatial skills, but not with other participant-speciﬁc background factors. The task speciﬁcations are released for the research community to apply and adapt in the study of computer-mediated social interaction.","author":[{"family":"Wikstrom","given":"Valtteri"},{"family":"Martikainen","given":"Silja"},{"family":"Falcon","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Ruistola","given":"Juha"},{"family":"Saarikivi","given":"Katri"}],"genre":"Under review","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Collaborative Block Design Task for Assessing Pair Performance in Virtual Reality and Reality","type":"manuscript"},

  {"id":"wisniewskaHybridityPuppetry2020","abstract":"Hybridity as the essence of puppetry is the key idea that is considered in the article. By reflecting upon aspects of in-betweenness in puppet performing practices, the conceptualization of puppetry’s hybridity permits us to overcome a prevalent view that reduces puppetry in terms of binary oppositions such as human/non-human, living/lifeless, tangible/intangible. In this regard, a hybrid perspective of puppetry enables the exploration of the connection between performer and performing object as a synergistic relationship. The three areas discussed in the article manifest some of the major and most influential strategies of performing ontological hybridity in the puppetry of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The first case focuses on Tadeusz Kantor’s bio-objects resulted in his theatre the genetically unique hybrid performer involved in creating the liminal, transgressive and subversive power of theatre. Based on contemporary puppet performances, the second part of the essay examines the ontological consequences of co-sharing and the interactive play of two bodies—the performer and the puppet. The final case deals with practices that merge puppeteering with complex forms of media, digital technologies and virtual environments. The article emphasizes the performative potential of perceptual multi-stability (after Erika Fisher-Lichte) produced by the hybrid puppet performing practices, resulting in the role of viewers as co-creators in puppetry hybridity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiśniewska","given":"Marzenna"}],"container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2020.1842032","ISSN":"1352-8165","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,18]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2020.1842032","page":"56-64","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"On Hybridity in Puppetry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2020.1842032","volume":"25"},

Not only has the general public’s usage of the word nothing to do with how the word is used in psychoanalytic circles, but every psychoanalytic tradition has its own unique understanding of “trauma.” The aim of this article is to show what role trauma plays in Lacanian psychoanalysis.\n\nPsychoanalytic thought defines itself in very different terms, in terms of traumas and their persistence. —Lacan, 1992, p. 10\n\nThe Freudian Definition of Trauma\n\nLet’s start by asking, “What is trauma?” The classic definition of the phenomenon can be found in Freud’s works; and we could say that Lacan, as a Freudian, would have no general objection to Freud’s following definition of “trauma”:\n\nWe describe as ‘traumatic’ any excitations from outside which are powerful enough to break through the protective shield. It seems to me that the concept of trauma necessarily implies a connection of this kind with a breach in an otherwise efficacious barrier against stimuli. Such an event as an external trauma is bound to provoke a disturbance on a large scale in the functioning of the organism’s energy and to set in motion every possible defensive measure (Freud, 1961, p. 23).\n\nFreud’s definition appeals to the common sense, so much so that it makes sense even to the layman. And in general, when reading Lacan, we should always keep Freud’s definition in mind; however, it needs to be said that Lacan, as usual, adds his own unique twists and turns to Freud’s simple definition.\n\nDiverging from Freud\n\nGiven Lacan’s reliance on Freud, it is important to point out the relation between neurosis and trauma in Freudian psychoanalysis before we go any further. Freud claims that “neurosis could […] be equated with a traumatic illness and would come about owing to inability to deal with an experience whose affective colouring was excessively powerful” (Freud, 1963, p. 275). If we accept the Lacanian assumption that there are no “normal” people, and that those whom we call normal are in fact neurotic, then it follows that everyone has their own trauma. This last point is crucial since according to Lacan, our traumas make us who we are. The idea that there is an essential substance which outlines our identity (or personality) is not foreign to Western thought; for Lacan, this essential substance is the traumatic kernel that each person possesses.\n\nAn example from popular culture may help drive the point home: in the TV series Westworld, we find an excellent Lacanian instance of how traumas make us human; consider the following conversation between Bernard and Ford:\n\n \tBERNARD: Why would you give me this?\n \tFORD: A child?\n \tBERNARD: This child’s death… only a monster would force that onto someone. Why do I return to it over and over? It’s my cornerstone, isn’t it? The thing my whole identity is organised around…\n \tFORD: Yes, Bernard. (Westworld, 2016) [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\nThis is textbook Lacanian psychoanalysis! It is as if Lacan himself had written the script. We need to keep two crucial points in mind when reading this dialogue: firstly, trauma is precisely the mentioned cornerstone that defines each person’s identity; secondly, the words which are used to describe repetitive and circular motions—italicised in the text above—refer to the circular motion of the Trieb [drive] around an objet a. To push my argument further, it could even be argued that in the above dialogue, the word “thing” is not without significance: for Lacan, the Thing [la chose, or das Ding], just like objet a, is positioned beyond the Symbolic. As a matter of fact, the two terms are not unrelated: in Lacan’s seminars, the concept “das Ding” gradually develops into the concept “objet petit a.”\n\nRepetition, Recollection, and Trauma\n\nIn his Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, Lacan takes a Kierkegaardian approach to tell us what trauma is. For Kierkegaard, Wiederholung [repetition] and Erinnerung [recollection] are two sides of the same coin: “Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward” (Kierkegaard, 1983, p. 131). Lacan agrees that these two concepts are related, but only to a certain extent: the limit which Lacan sets for this backward repetition is the Real. In other words, the patient can recollect his past minus the traumatic events. The traumatic events are unsymbolised for the subject; therefore, the subject cannot possibly recall those events; no matter how hard the subject might try, they would not overcome the void created by the trauma they have undergone. Viewed from this perspective, Lacan’s approach might not seem strictly Freudian; nevertheless, Freud had understood the limits of recollection despite claiming that “hysterical symptoms can be resolved if, starting from them, we are able to find the path back to the memory of a traumatic experience” (Freud, 1962, p. 195). Consider the following passage:\n\n“It is true that in the earliest days of analytic technique we took an intellectualist view of the situation. We set a high value on the patient’s knowledge of what he had forgotten, and in this we made hardly any distinction between our knowledge of it and his. We thought it a special piece of good luck if we were able to obtain information about the forgotten childhood trauma from other sources—for instance, from parents or nurses or the seducer himself—as in some cases it was possible to do; and we hastened to convey the information and the proofs of its correctness to the patient, in the certain expectation of thus bringing the neurosis and the treatment to a rapid end (Freud, 1958, p. 141).\n\nHere, we see strong similarities between the two thinkers. Freud had realised that secondary accounts of a traumatic event are far more reliable than the patient’s own account of the event. In fact, if the patient did “recall” something, it would be nothing more than a fantasy woven by the patient himself—a case of false memory. This is where the repetitive motion of the Trieb around the object a comes into play, for this repetitive motion is directly related to trauma. Fantasy is created by the repetitive motion of the Trieb around the objet a: when some (traumatic) event disrupts the symbolic order, a void gets formed in the Symbolic; this void is better known as objet a, and trauma is the disruptive event during which “the [objet] a is isolated by the Other and it is constituted as a remainder in the subject’s relation to the Other” (Lacan, 2014, p. 114). Thus, fantasy is created around a meaningless void, and its function is to produce the illusion of coherence; as a result, the traumatic event is perceived by the subject as something compatible with the rest of the subject’s symbolic universe.\n\nWith the help of fantasy, each person makes sense of their otherwise meaningless traumatic experience. Therefore, it is not the case that the subject recalls absolutely nothing; the subject does recall something, but this something is not the objective account of the traumatic event. For the subject, the traumatic event is literally non-sense [non-sens] and devoid of meaning. It is the function of fantasy to give meaning, or at least the illusion of meaningfulness, to the meaningless traumatic event:\n\n“The place of the real […] stretches from the trauma to the phantasy” (1998, p. 60), and “phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinant in the function of repetition” (Lacan, 1998, p. 60).\n\nThe Trauma of Birth\n\nIn the TV series Westworld, Bernard was given a traumatic event to make him more humanlike, but you need not worry if your life is less traumatic than Bernard’s—that doesn’t make you less human than an android. According to Lacan, there is one essential and common trauma that we all share: in his Seminar X, Lacan goes so far as to suggest that getting born is a traumatic experience—he calls this “le trauma de la naissance” [the trauma of birth]. We all share this common trauma, because we all emerge into the same “Other environment.”\n\nThe trauma of birth might make us human on a fundamental level, but it doesn’t explain why we differ as individuals. If we want to know what makes us unique as individuals, we need to take into consideration the traumas people undergo after birth.\n\nReference\n\n \tFreud, S. (1958).

The glove provides both active finger flexion and extension for hand assistance and rehabilitative training, through its embedded fabric-based actuators that are fabricated by heat press and ultrasonic welding of flexible thermoplastic polyurethane-coated fabrics. Compared to previous developed elastomeric-based actuators, the actuators are able to achieve smaller bend radius and generate sufficient force and torque to assist in both finger flexion and extension at lower air pressure. In this letter, experiments were conducted to characterize the performances of the glove in terms of its kinematic and grip strength assistances on five healthy participants. Additionally, we present a graphical-user interface that allows user to choose the desired rehabilitation exercises and control modes, which include button-controlled-assistive mode, cyclic movement training, intention-driven task-specific training, and bilateral rehabilitation training.","author":[{"family":"Yap","given":"H.

Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in bridging the semantic gap, this paper proposes to bridge the emotional gap based on a multimodal Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN), which fuses the audio and visual cues in a deep model. This multimodal DCNN is trained with two stages. First, two DCNN models pretrained on large-scale image data are ﬁne-tuned to perform audio and visual emotion recognition tasks respectively on the corresponding labeled speech and face data. Second, the outputs of these two DCNNs are integrated in a fusion network constructed by a number of fully-connected layers. The fusion network is trained to obtain a joint audio-visual feature representation for emotion recognition. Experimental results on the RML audio-visual database demonstrates the promising performance of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is an early work fusing audio and visual cues in DCNN for emotion recognition. Its success guarantees further research in this direction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shiqing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shiliang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Tiejun"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Wen"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval - ICMR '16","DOI":"10.1145/2911996.2912051","event":"the 2016 ACM","event-place":"New York, New York, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4359-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"281-284","publisher":"ACM Press","publisher-place":"New York, New York, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multimodal Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2911996.2912051"},
