# Statement
I am a first-year doctoral student at Aalto University’s school in Arts, Design and Architecture; in the department of media. My Master’s thesis: Soft Robotic Incarnation [@peledSoftRoboticIncarnation2019], was done at the same department. There is a dire need for creative and technological solutions in my home country, Israel, and its conflict with the Palestinian people. In the past decade I have been focusing my efforts and navigating my prior experience in science and technology  for this purpose. I am hoping that through my doctoral studies I will be able to promote positive social change not only in Israel but also in other locations suffering from similar issues of prejudice and alienation.

This research deals with intergroup contact; the simple, and yet, elusive idea that in order for two social groups to reduce the prejudice and animosity between them, they have to find a way to meet. Since initiating face-to-face contact between groups in protracted and violent conflicts is challenging at the least, conflict resolution efforts have expanded into various forms of indirect contact: second-degree contact through a mutual acquaintance, simulated contact through guided imagination, and different forms of contact mediated by technology. Within the scope of technological mediation, virtual forms of encounter such as online gaming and VR have taken the center stage, whereas little attention has been given to robots. This, despite apparent shortcomings caused by the inherent virtuality and personality abstraction of virtual contact. The following sections outline the research plan for hypothesizing and testing the viability of contact mediated by telepresence robots, acting as corporeal avatars of human individuals, and fabricated in participatory workshops. The research will contribute in three main innovations to the academic community: 1) The first contact hypothesis for telepresence robots; theorizing on the required conditions for a positive outcome , 2) A novel design for a robotic avatar toolkit that is tailored specifically for telepresence contact and is designed to be fabricated by an inexperienced user, and 3) The first ever field test for telepresence robot contact between Israelis and Palestinians.

With lessons learned from the production of my previous soft robotic telepresence: HITODAMA, I will produce a new toolkit that allows inexperienced workshop participants to design and produce their soft avatar. The robots would be deployed in a public space and controllers would manage interactions with passersby through their mobile devices or desktops over the Internet. At the core test case, participants from Palestine would construct their avatars in a workshop and have them pop-up in public spaces in Israel. The Palestinians will be able to converse with Israelis beyond the separation wall without exposing their identity.  By opening the soft robot’s production to a participatory workshop in an intergroup conflict context (Tajfel, Turner, Austin, & Worchel, 1979), I hope to achieve two main outcomes: 1) Proliferation of technical and scientific knowledge and empowerment in an oppressed group. 2) Personal artistic and emotional expression of the oppressed. The research is divided into milestones in which design decisions and hypotheses would be put to the test and publications would follow.

# Grant request
For the first year of my research, between 02/2020 and 02/2021 I was able to get hired as a paid researcher by Aalto university. However, starting March 2021 I will be without funding. I therefore apply for a 1-year grant between 03/2021 and 03/2022. 

# Research overview

## Intergroup contact and the dissolution of prejudice

This dissertation will focus on prejudice as a major component in intergroup conflict (Pettigrew, 2011), identifying the major drivers of prejudice and therefore possible paths for mitigation.  Gordon Allport’s Nature of Prejudice (1954) lays the foundation for the Contact Hypothesis: A theory suggesting that an interpersonal contact between groups can reduce prejudice. Allport suggests four conditions for an organized encounter that need to be fulfilled for the contact to be effective: equal status, common goals, cooperation, and institutional support. Fifty years later, a meta-analysis conducted by Pettigrew and Tropp was able to validate the hypothesis across a large number of studies (2006). It was also shown, however, that Allport’s conditions are not strictly essential for a positive outcome, rather they facilitate the transition to a reduction of prejudice. New variables were introduced as primary moderators and mediators for prejudice reduction in contact (Brown and Hewstone). Affective factors mediate the formed attitude between the groups: anxiety negatively and empathy positively.  The salience of group identity within the conversation moderates the generalization of attitudes from the interpersonal level to the group level.

Communication technology expands the models of contact and adds new modalities of interaction while giving up the benefits of face-to-face encounters. Research on online intergroup contact (Amichai-Hamburger, Hasler, & Shani-Sherman, 2015; Hasler & Amichai-Hamburger, 2013) has shown that despite obstacles set by the medium , there is a potential for online intergroup contact to reduce prejudice and aid in conflict resolution. 
As shown also in Walther et al (2015), the mere contact is not enough, but the content and context of the contact determine whether the result would be positive or negative. VR has also been studied, primarily as an “empathy machine”, allowing intergroup members to immerse themselves in the perspective of the other side. Other research focused on simulated, pre-recorded contact, optimized for making one side feeling empathy toward the other (Hasler, Hirschberger, Shani-Sherman, & Friedman, 2014; Hasson et al., 2019; Kabiljo, 2019).  

 As mentioned above, soft robotic telepresence adds an intercorporeal dimension to contact, which may increase the efficacy of the encounter and aid in the release of prejudice. So far, no attempt was made to apply the contact hypothesis to the field of robotic telepresence. Finding out whether such an encounter is beneficial for conflict resolution could contribute greatly to the academic and peace-activist community.
Additionally, allowing the out-group members to design their own avatar could utilize principles of expressive art therapy. The participants would get a chance to freely mold their self-image into a non-human avatar, which may have therapeutic benefits (Muri, 2007; Sholt & Gavron, 2006). Applying self-expression techniques with Palestinians in intergroup conflict could also benefit from Boal’s theory of the Theatre of the Oppressed (Boal, 2008). The controllers would be able to design their expressions into the robot, whether it is an offensive hand gesture or an offer for peace. Combining technological and expressive arts techniques with pedagogy and empowerment of the oppressed provides a transdisciplinary approach to conflict resolution in asymmetrical intergroup conflicts.

The notion of reification was popularized by Lukács’ interpretation (1971) of Marx’s commodity fetishism (2015). Marx wrote about a transition that occurred in the way society values objects: While at first, objects were valued by their essence, their objective nature and use-value, capitalist society started ‘fetishizing’ objects by assigning them abstract properties that are not a part of the material object. Lukács took this phenomenon one step further and showed how the entire organization of society and human consciousness get ‘reified’; Wage labor transformed the human into a commodity object, and societal life became rationalized under arbitrary systems of value. Adorno and Horkheimer of the Frankfurt school of critical theory took these theories as the basis for explaining the moral deterioration of society and the loss of our natural human values into falsely rationalized systems of rules, such as those that emerged in World War II (Adorno & Horkheimer, 1997).
There is a clear connection between reification, rationalization, and intergroup prejudice. Sarah Ahmed developed a theory of Stranger Fetishism (2000), demonstrating the clear connection between prejudice and commodity fetishism. In Ahmed’s view, abstract information about the stereotypical figure of the stranger circulates through mass-media, intensifying, like a currency, as it is exchanged from source to source. This wounds up creating an emotional fetishism toward the figure of the other. We can also approach the same scenario through Jürgen Habermas’ thesis of the colonization of the Lifeworld (1984). Habermas views invasive steering media, such as money and power, as an interference to the process of reaching a rational agreement inter-subjectively. Without a mutual agreement on rationality, Habermas asserts, political discussion is not possible.
Since this research deals with technological mediation in intergroup conflict, I am interested both in identifying the reifying forces in current communication technology, such as social media (Heyman & Pierson, 2015), and the technologies that could be used to mitigate those forces. Borrowing from the writings of Simone Weil (2002) and Edgar Orion (2012), I have previously dubbed the name incarnation as a reversal of reification (Peled, 2019). I assert that in a mediated conversation between individuals, when a depth of irreducible human qualities is reliably communicated, it is likely to reduce fetishism and prejudice. Following this assumption, I hypothesize that an incarnation could be achieved via two main factors: 1) Expressiveness and 2) Corporeality. In contrast to technological initiatives that attempt to expose nuanced human qualities in mediated interaction using biofeedback sensors, I opt for active expression by the interlocutors. In a robotic telepresence scenario, this means allowing the creator of the avatar to design the appearance and movements of their robot, and trigger those movements only when intended. The potential for custom-designed social robots was demonstrated by Suguitan and Hoffman (2019) - I wish to take this further by introducing co-design of actuation and behavior.
The second important factor is Corporeality, or in its inter-subjective form Intercorporeality. This term was coined by phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1968) and is used to describe the tight physical interdependence between humans that is constitutive not only to social cognition but also to the nature of Being, the conscious experience. I hypothesize that in a mediated encounter, more physical interaction is more authentic to the interlocutors’ logos - the essence of their social being, their voice (Edgar, 2012; Rancière, 1999). To the contrary, an abstract, flat, and virtual experience could leave a void that is a soil for growing a biased and fetishized figure of the stranger in the interlocutors’ mind. I intend to test the viability of the soft robotics medium, with its organic and nonlinear style of movement, to enable an intercorporeal experience when compared to a traditional motorized robot or a virtual encounter.
Apart from the soft materiality of the robot, design choices carry a crucial role in determining the position of the experience on the intercorporeal scale. The use and location of a display, turn-taking dynamics, modalities of language, the fluidity and dynamic range of the controls and robotic motion, the field of view of the camera, feedback signals - these are all elements that vary the user experience as a whole, shifting the perception of the interlocutors, their view of the robot, and their view of each other. Pursuing these questions under the scope of a doctoral dissertation would provide me with ample time to delve into each UX element, placing them on the intercorporeal scale, designing variations and testing them in the field.


## Post-humanoid, web-based, soft robotic toolkit for telepresence


In this dissertation, I will create a modular, easy to use toolkit for the preparation of remote-controlled soft robotic avatars. The toolkit would allow participants to design their movements using flexible methods such as origami-inspired structures [@peraza-hernandezOrigamiinspiredActiveStructures2014]. The modules would then be connected to a central pneumatic system and communication controller that automatically provides conversation and actuation capabilities, including language translation and remote control via the mobile web (see [@fig:diagram]).

![Modular Soft robotic control: Architecture diagram](./diagram.jpg){#fig:diagram}


To illustrate the process, a use-case scenario is presented as follows:

1. Participant A from Palestine decides they want to appear as a talking bird, colored according to the flag of Palestine.
2. Participant A creates the body and face of the bird from soft materials such as fabrics and soft plastics and wraps the body around the controller unit.
3. Participant A creates two bending origami actuators ^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PQT3vRf-qA] as the wings of the bird, covers them with feathers, and attaches their air vent to the main controller unit.
4. The robot bird is placed in a public park in Israel, and participant A connects to the control interface with his mobile phone.
5. Participant A notices through the robot's camera an Israeli couple passing by, and triggers a recording of a bird call that they prepared in advance on the interface.
6. The couple notices the bird and approaches the robot.
7. Participant A types in Arabic "Hello there, would you listen to my story?" and instructs the robot to speak in Hebrew.
8. The couple answers "Yes" in Hebrew and the robot records and translates their response to Arabic before it is shown on Participant A's interface.
9. Participant A flaps the bird's wings using the web interface, the couple approaches and touches the wings.
10. Participant A starts telling their story.

The majority of the technology for the central communication controller was already developed during the Master's thesis. Upcoming technical research will focus on new soft actuator designs that favor simplicity and flexibility over strength and precision. The actuators need to be easily produced in a workshop scenario with inexperienced participants and inexpensive materials. Insofar as the avatar is designed for expressiveness and social communication rather than explicit functional tasks, organic mistakes and deformations are a welcomed addition and not a mark of failure. I draw inspiration from the maker culture and the _Hebocon_ robot competition ^[https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/diy/hebocon-the-best-worst-robot-competition], as well from on my own experience in delivering workshops ^[https://vimeo.com/210919628]. Additional research will be dedicated to developing remote control methods that take better advantage of the soft medium and allow for more fluid control. One example could be the use of the phone's accelerometer or finger-sliding, to control the pneumatic system in real-time, producing a fluid motion.

# Advisors 

I have confirmed the availability of three advisors for my studies: 

1. **Prof. Teemu Leinonen:** Head of the Learning Environments research group and supervisor of my studies.

2. **Dr. Mia Muurimäki:** A former Aalto Media Lab faculty and now a service designer team leader in Futurice. Mia has helped me during my Master's thesis in a multitude of ways. She directed me to relevant literature, suggested design changes and advised me on project management and schedules. Mia has been conducting participatory and co-design workshops in Futurice and I am sure she will also be able to advise me in that field.

3. **Dr. Béatrice Hasler:** Founder of VR-CORE: Virtual Reality Lab for Conflict Research in IDC Herzliya research school in Israel. Béatrice has years of experience researching virtual intergroup contact in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has studied online collaboration. Beatrice graciously offered to advise and participate in this research and has introduced me to missing links in social psychology that are essential for this dissertation.

# Time-line

I propose to divide my studies into four milestones in four years. Three milestones will produce a publication, and the final product is the dissertation, aggregating and concluding the research. The milestones suggested are as follows:

1. **Soft Robotic Telepresence for intergroup contact**: A literature review of social-psychology, phenomenology and critical theory evaluating the potential of soft robotic telepresence for fulfilling the contact hypothesis. The study would include a comparison to other forms of intergroup contact, and if possible a prototype and test for a simple soft robot that could test the hypothesis. _Due to the COVID-19 pandemic^[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019], practical tests might not be possible_

2. **A modular, DIY soft robotic avatar**: I will present a pedagogical and therapeutic toolkit for creating your soft robotic avatar and evaluate it with a test group study. The expressive and therapeutic advantage of the DIY robot would be tested against a pre-made robot in an intergroup contact scenario.

3. **Intergroup conflict resolution with modular soft robotic avatars**: Based on results from the previous studies, the toolkit would be put to the test in a real-world scenario in Israel-Palestine. I will be conducting workshops in Palestine and place the robots in Israel. The potential for reducing prejudice would be evaluated.

4. **Dissertation**: The final dissertation would aggregate the three papers and invoke an encompassing discussion on the conclusions, suggesting alternatives and devising plans to move forward.

Additionally, during the studies, I will take 60 ECTS of courses. The following graph outlines the planned schedule for the studies on a month-by-month basis. I refer to the four milestones as _Telepresence Contact, Modular Avatar, Workshops, and Dissertation_:

# Bifurcations into other fields

Throughout my doctoral studies, I plan to initiate two main bifurcations in the fields of AI and Bio-Art. Those would be side-projects in which I will inspect the potential to incorporate new elements into my research.

## AI
Over the past year, I have been involved as a co-creator in the _Marrow_ project with Shirin Anlen^[https://shirin.works/Marrow-dev-phase-Machine-learning-immersive-theater-WIP]. The project speculates about the possibility of mental illness occurring in AIs and uses storytelling and theatrical methods to discuss its research findings. While the skills I have acquired during working on Marrow could be useful in augmenting robotic mediation by adding supporting layers to intergroup contact, the main inspiration I draw from this project is a critical perspective on AI. Machine learning systems are increasingly prevalent in society, acting as a steering media, increasing rationalization and reification in interpersonal relations. When adding machine learning support to telerobotic mediation, my experience from Marrow teaches me that AI should be used cautiously and critically, with high awareness of the learning process behind the machine. The importance of transparency of AI will be discussed in the research articles exploring the use of telepresence in conflict resolution.  


## Bio-Art
I have always been interested in and involved in Bio-Art initiatives. My main curiosity revolves around the combination of biological elements and machine logic, both practically and conceptually. A project that I never got around to implement involved the extraction of human DNA and transplanting it into plants. ^[http://avner.js.org/#jewish-roots]. In the context of robotic telepresence, I am interested in the possibilities of encoding parts of our DNA into avatars. Deriving from that is also the need for community-based knowledge in human genome sequencing [@jainNanoporeSequencingAssembly2018].  Incorporating biological elements into telerobotic avatars could raise important questions about the relationship between humans and machines. These topics will be part of research and studied more deeply in one of the sub-studies conducted and published in one of the research articles.

#   Funding
Funding for the first year of my studies is secured through a hired doctoral candidate position at the Learning Environments group. Support for the following three years would be obtained either by grant applications or through dedicated research project budgets.
