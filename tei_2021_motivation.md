# Motivation letter: TEI Studio Design for Playfulness Workshop

## About me
Hi! My name is Avner Peled. I am a doctoral student at the Aalto Media Lab, Finland, and a creative technology consultant for the New York Times (based in Finland). My research in Aalto investigates the use of soft telerobots as avatars that facilitate communication, contact, and conflict resolution between groups. In my Master's thesis [@peledSoftRoboticIncarnation2019], I produced a pneumatic silicone-based telerobot named _HITODAMA_ (Japanese for _human spirit_). _HITODAMA_ is operated via a web interface and has a variety of expressive and mediating functions (Fig. 1). I have also conducted [soft robotic workshops](https://vimeo.com/210919628) and I am [open-sourcing](https://github.com/Avnerus/softbot) and [documenting](https://wiki.avner.us/doku.php?id=soft-robotics:start) all of my research.

## Intereset in workshop
In my doctoral studies, I am looking at how contact through telerobots could have a potential political impact [@peledPotentialTelepresenceRobots2020]. Recently, I found myself returning to the more traditional form of [political puppet theaters](https://www.garyfriedmanproductions.com/puppets-apartheid.html). Telerobotics could create an even more empowering and borderless form of political theater, where the puppeteer could be located anywhere outside the theater, even in a different country [See inspiration in Fig. 2 @jwu-shenghuGlovePuppetRobot2008]. Now, with the help of [Emmi Pouta](https://emmipouta.com/), I am exploring accessible manufacturing methods for textile-based _double glove puppets_: A sensor on one end and a robot on the other. Initial experiments have only just begun (Fig. 3), and I believe attending the TEI workshop could infuse my ideas further, and I can share the knowledge I have gained so far with others to create exciting cross-overs    
Thank you!
